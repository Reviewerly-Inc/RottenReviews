Observing that the overestimation issue will latter becomes underestimation during the learning process. Thus motivated, this work proposes the Blended Exploitation and Exploration (BEE) operator to take advantage of the historical best-perforation actions. The proposed operator is then used in both model-free and model-based settings and show better performance than previous methods. 1. The proposed BEE operator utilizes the Bellman exploitation operator and exploration operator to address the under-exploitation issue. The proposed operator can be easily incorporated into the RL algorithms.
2. The experiments show that the proposed operator can effectively reduce the estimation error and achieve better performance comparing with other RL algorithms. 1. The terminology can be misleading. The overestimation issue in the Q-value approximation generally is due to the changing order of expectation and $\max$. It is incorrect to say that  the $Q$-function will have ""underestimation when encountering successes"" in Fig 1 (a). The authors need to clarify the context and difference of the statement in order to avoid confusion.
2. In order to investigate on the under-exploitation, the metric $\Delta(\cdot,\cdot)$ is defined on the current Q-function approximation. Intuitively,   $\Delta(\cdot,\cdot)$ shows that the current Q-function approximation can be either overestimate or underestimate given different policy, i.e., $\mu_k$ and $\pi_k$. It is unclear what is the meaning of this metric. Considering most of the algorithm will update the policy and Q-function approximation at the same time, e.g., Actor-Critic, the Q-function should be evaluated under the current policy instead of the policy obtained earlier. The authors need to clarify why the definition here makes sense for the under-exploitation investigation.

The paper highlights the importance of incorporating past successes to improve Q-value estimation and policy learning. The proposed BAC and MB-BAC algorithms outperform existing methods in various continuous control tasks and demonstrate strong performance in real-world robot tasks. - The paper addresses an important issue in off-policy actor-critic methods and proposes a novel approach to improve Q-value estimation and policy learning. 
- The BEE operator is simple yet effective and can be easily integrated into existing off-policy actor-critic frameworks.
- The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in various continuous control tasks and real-world robot tasks. 1. The novelty of the proposed approach is limited. 
2. The choice of $\lambda$ is largely empirical and requires extra manipulation in new tasks.
3. The paper only provides basic theoretical analysis, such as the accurate policy evaluation and the guarantee of policy improvement. The benefit of linearly combining two Q-value functions is not discussed theoretically.
4. The experiments are conducted in continuous control tasks with dense rewards. The exploration ability can be better evaluated in environments with sparse rewards.
5. There is a lack of discussions with related papers (See Question 3). 1. Emprically, the BAC algoithm will only be more efficient in exploiting the replay buffer. The exploration still rely on the maximum-extropy formulation in SAC. Then why can BAC perform significantly better than SAC in failure-prone scenarios such as HumanoidStandup, as if BAC can better explore the unknown regions?
2. Can you discuss or exhibit the performance of BAC in some tasks with sparse rewards? This can demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach.
3. What are the advantages of BAC compared with prioritized replay methods \[1,2\] or advantage-based methods \[3\]? These methods are related to BAC in that they also exploit the replay buffer with inductive bias, so they should be mentioned in the paper.

The instantiations of our method in both model-free and model-based settings outperform state-of-the-art methods in various continuous control tasks and achieve strong performance in failure-prone scenarios and real-world robot tasks","Motivated by the problem of underestimating values in the training of SAC, this paper introduces the Blended Exploitation and Exploration (BEE) operator, which calculates the TD target based on a combination of the standard TD target and a high expectile of the return distribution. The authors integrate this operator in both model-free and model-based scenarios, followed by a comprehensive experimental evaluation. 1. The paper contains extensive experiment results on both simulation and real-world environments.
2. The paper is written clearly and easy to follow. Figure 1 provides a decent visualization of the underestimation issue. 1. The BAC method tunes its $\lambda$ and $\tau$ differently for tasks in MuJoCo and DMC (Table 1 & 5). It's questionable to claim superiority over other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like SAC and TD3, which use consistent hyperparameters (HP) across tasks. Adjusting HP for each task can inflate results as seen in Figure 5, which can be misleading. Why not showcase the automatic $\lambda$ tuning methods from Appendix B.3.3 in the main text if they're effective?

2. Figure 23 reveals that SAC, without the double-Q-trick, still underestimates in the Humanoid task. It's unclear if this is universally true. More convincing results would come from testing this across multiple tasks and providing absolute Q value estimates. I still suspect that Q underestimation largely stems from the double Q techniques, as suggested by the RL community \[1\]. For instance, OAC \[1\] introduces $\beta_{\text{LB}}$ to manage value estimation issues.

3. Presuming the Q value underestimation problem is widely recognized (which I invite the authors to contest), the paper seems to lack innovation. The BEE operator, at its core, appears to be a fusion of existing Bellman operators.

4. The statement ""BEE exhibits no extra overestimation"" seems conditional on specific $\lambda$ and $\tau$ values. For instance, using $\lambda = 1$ and $\tau = 1$ could induce overestimation.

There is no explicit reference to a filtering process after those keyword-based search results, was there any filtering step?

>**TL;DR:** **Good paper.** The proposed WTA-CRS algorithm is based on the existing CRS algorithm and is used to reduce activation memory during training. WTA-CRS achieves up to 2.7× peak memory reduction with almost no accuracy drop and enables up to 6.4× larger batch size. However, WTA-CRS comes with computational overhead, which is discussed and explore. Addressing my concerns and questions would improve my score.

The paper proposes the WTA-CRS algorithm to reduce the neural networks training activation memory, where the paper claims that activation memory is primary memory bottleneck during training. The WTA-CRS algorithm is an unbiased estimators for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient. WTA-CRS achieves up to 2.7× peak memory reduction with almost no accuracy drop and enables up to 6.4× larger batch size.

The WTA-CRS algorithm works by sampling columns and rows to create an unbiased estimation of the original GEMM for the backpropagation. The WTA-CRS algorithm does not alter the neural architecture, and therefore the inference speed is left in tact. The experimental section shows that WTA-CRS outperforms existing prior work and is compatible with existing PEFT techniques. WTA-CRS adds a computational overhead due to sampling, however, WTA-CRS enables training on much larger batch sizes, which results in a 1.2× higher training throughput.

To reduce memory usage during training, we sample the most likely column indices during backpropagation.

Furthermore, they proposed method demonstrates the ability to significantly reduce peak memory usage, by approximately up to 2.7 times, when fine-tuning downstream tasks. It also showcases the potential for higher throughput, enabling more efficient training. 1. The work clearly states its motivation and its solution and is easy to follow.
2. The authors show that their method reaches comparable performance with backpropagation using the full activation when combined with LoRA.
3. They also empirically measure throughput gains obtained by increasing batch size, which demonstrates the practical applicability of their method. 1. The paper needs a comparative analysis of other researchs, such as gradient checkpoint/recalculation and CRS, aimed at reducing activation memory during the training phase, as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 9.
2. The paper should include an analysis of the overhead associated with the proposed WTS-CRS method, which involves sampling rows and columns. It is crucial to consider factors such as the computational cost of Equation 3 and any potential effects of lowering on the overall performance. Providing this analysis would enhance the clarity and completeness of the research.
3. There is a need of analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed approach, WTS-CRS, in distributed training environments such as tensor parallelism or pipeline parallelism.
4. It seems necessary to conduct performance evaluations on various LLMs of the GPT family, such as LLaMA and OPT. * In Figure 9, it can be observed that the throughput of WTS-CRS is lower than that of full when the batch size is small. Is this due to the overhead caused by lowering?

194,Reviewer-ky3t,Winner-Take-All Column Row Sampling for Memory Efficient Adaptation of Language Model,"As the model size grows rapidly, fine-tuning the large pre-trained language model has become increasingly difficult due to its extensive memory usage. 
Previous works usually focus on reducing the number of trainable parameters in the network. 
While the model parameters do contribute to memory usage, the primary memory bottleneck during training arises from storing feature maps, also known as activations, as they are crucial for gradient calculation. 
Notably, machine learning models are typically trained using stochastic gradient descent.
We argue that in stochastic optimization, models can handle noisy gradients as long as the gradient estimator is unbiased with reasonable variance.
Following this motivation, we propose a new family of unbiased estimators called \sas, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient.
Our work provides both theoretical and experimental evidence that, in the context of tuning transformers, our proposed estimators exhibit lower variance compared to existing ones.
By replacing the linear operation with our approximated one in transformers, we can achieve up to 2.7X peak memory reduction with almost no accuracy drop and enables up to $6.4\times$ larger batch size.
Under the same hardware, \sas enables better down-streaming task performance by applying larger models and/or faster training speed with larger batch sizes.
The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/WTACRS-A5C5/.","The paper's contribution is in proposing a practical, intuitive yet not trivial unbiased approximation to gradient training of matrix multiplication. It shows that even though totally deterministic sampling is biased, somewhat deterministic sampling is unbiased, and a judicious allocation of sampling to those pairs favored by deterministic thinking can lead to the use of a larger batch size with empirically negligible performance loss. This reviewer must declare that he does not check the derivation very carefully. The proposed idea is practical and can be readily combined with virtually all first-order gradient-based training methods.
The paper also derived why deterministic sampling is a biased estimator and empirically shown the associated bad performance, thus proving that the additional complexity of stochastic sampling over deterministic sampling is not only sufficiently better but also necessary. It's just a few empirical comparisons, but the performance gap between CRS and WTA-CRS seems modest. This reviewer does not have a question.

These conditional independencies are related to zeros in the precision matrix. Typically, sparse enforcing norms are used to estimate the precision matrix while enforcing zeros in the elements outside of the diagonal. In this paper a Bayesian approach is considered. For this a pseudo-distribution for the data is considered by taking the exponential to the p-norm. The method is trained via variational inference combined with normalizing flows to increase the accuracy of the posterior approximation. The variational distribution is tuned via simulated annealing and a temperature parameter allows to interpolate between the Bayesian and the Map solution. - Well written paper.

        Another point of criticism is that, for some particular values of the p parameter one does not actually observe sparsity in the Bayesian solution.

Up to my knowledge, this is the first time flows are applied to the space of positive definite matrices.

The key is to model the transferrable relationships between different relations across knowledge graphs. Specifically, a NBFNet is used to learn relative relation representations and generate relation embeddings, which is then fed into another NBFNet to perform link predictions. Extensive experiments are performed over many knowledge graph to demonstrate the performance of this model. - This paper is well written and easy to follow
- The core method around the relative relationships between relations is clever and interesting.
- The experiments demonstrate the gains of the method. It is especially impressive to see the competitive zero-shot performance of ULTRA over different knowledge graphs. - The proposed method relies entirely on knowledge graph structure and does not consider using node embedding such as textual features of the knowledge graphs.

Fine-tuning further boosts the performance.","Paper claims to propose a foundation model, named Ultra, for knowledge graph representation learning. The proposed model can handle full inductive graphs in which new entities and relations may appear in the test set. To do so, the authors propose to lift the graph to a one with relations as the nodes and design 4 different edge types (head2head, head2tail, tail2head, tail2tail). The relational representations are then learnt using message passing on this graph. The learnt relation embeddings are then used in the original graph to perform inductive link prediction. For the experiments, the authors pre-train their method on 3 KGs and further evaluate in a zero-shot setting and also by fine-tuning the downstream tasks. - The paper proposes a transductive model that works in settings of new relations and entity nodes.
- The method obtains good zero-shot pretraining results. - The authors have not explicitly stated the computational complexity of the method. From the paper, it seems that the forward pass is run on the entire relational graph to obtain relation representations. This is then used to initialize the node embedding from the query triple and the process is repeated for every triple. Thus it seems that the entire graph is being used for link prediction every triple making the computational complexity O(E^2). This seems limiting for large graphs that have not been explored in the paper (such as wikidata-5m etc.).
- From Table 2 we can see that finetuning over the pre-trained models helps the results significantly over the 0-shot setting. Also, the fine-tuning steps are too large to claim few shot results. This weakens the claim of the ""foundation model"" for KGs. A fair comparison would be to show the pretraining results for other inductive and transductive methods as well in addition to the SOTA comparison.
- Another limitation is that of scale. Since the current model has fewer parameters, this would limit learning over larger pretraining datasets as can be seen in Figure 6 and also reported by the authors.
- SoTA results for transductive models are better than the pre-trained Ultra model in many datasets. Thus the Ultra model seems to work well for the inductive setting rather than transductive. Thus the claim of the ""foundation model"" seems broader in scope.
- We see that in the metafam dataset, the pretraining results are poor but on finetuning the results are improved drastically. This shows that the method works well in cases where the relational patterns of the downstream datasets are similar to the pre-trained one but when the data distribution changes the results suffer. Moreover, due to limited capacity, the model may not be able to handle such cases by increasing the pretraining datasets calling for downstream finetuning. Thus domain adaptation is not a problem which can be easily overcome by scaling the current model and this further weakens the claim of a ""foundation model"" for KGs. - For weakness point 2: Any reason why this was not done by the authors?

-  For weakness point 4: Could the authors comment on why this would be the case and how would the model be improved to handle the transductive setting?

9,Reviewer-KmBd,Addressing Loss of Plasticity and Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning,"Deep representation learning methods struggle with continual learning, suffering from both catastrophic forgetting of useful units and loss of plasticity, often due to rigid and unuseful units. While many methods address these two issues separately, only a few currently deal with both simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce Utility-based Perturbed Gradient Descent (UPGD) as a novel approach for the continual learning of representations. UPGD combines gradient updates with perturbations, where it applies smaller modifications to more useful units, protecting them from forgetting, and larger modifications to less useful units, rejuvenating their plasticity. We use a challenging streaming learning setup where continual learning problems have hundreds of non-stationarities and unknown task boundaries. We show that many existing methods suffer from at least one of the issues, predominantly manifested by their decreasing accuracy over tasks. On the other hand, UPGD continues to improve performance and surpasses or is competitive with all methods in all problems. Finally, in extended reinforcement learning experiments with PPO, we show that while Adam exhibits a performance drop after initial learning, UPGD avoids it by addressing both continual learning issues.","This paper introduces a novel approach called Utility-based Perturbed Gradient Descent (UPGD) to address catastrophic forgetting and loss of plasticity in neural networks. UPGD combines gradient updates with a mask to protect useful weights from being forgotten and reuse less useful weights. The paper also proposes metrics to evaluate loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, the method outperforms existing methods in streaming learning problems in terms of retaining plasticity and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. **Originality**
Conceptually, the problem addressed by the authors of avoiding forgetting while retaining plasticity in streaming learning settings remains underexplored. The specific method proposed by the authors is relatively straightforward and conceptually similar to prior approaches; however, it empirically outperforms prior methods as the experimental results demonstrate.

The convergence guarantee results are valuable. The experiments are generally comprehensive and well-conducted. Assessing the quality of the approximated utilities in section 4.1 is 
of critical importance, and the results are convincing. Conducting miniImagenet scale experiments is a solid addition to the experimental section. The ablation study in Figure 8 is also insightful.

**Clarity**
The writing is generally clear and the figures are well-illustrated.

**Significance**
Overall, the paper addresses a major issue in the field of streaming learning. Given that the paper doesn't investigate the theoretical properties of UPGD, the significance of the paper hinges on the strength of the empirical results. Since the proposed method lacks theoretical performance guarantees, its empirical performance is critical. The authors have generally done a good job demonstrating that UPGD avoids forgetting and maintains plasticity; however, a few concerns remain:

- It appears that S-EWC does not have too much of a gap with UPGD judging from figure 7: it entirely avoids catastrophic forgetting, and the only setting where it loses plasticity where UPGD does not is on MNIST
- S-MAS outperforms UPGD on miniImagenet at the end of training, and does not have a large gap overall
- The ablation of figure 8 checks the contribution of each component of UPGD sequentially as they are added to regular SGD. Ideally, the ablation would study how each component affects UPGD when they are *individually* removed (e.g. UPGD without WP).

**Minor comments**
Figure 7 is referred to before Figure 6; ideally, their order would be swapped.
I see in Section 4 that the results are averaged over 20 trials, but the meaning of the error margins in some of the figures is not made clear (e.g. figure 2). I would also suggest increasing the number of trials to smooth out the curves if possible. Is it possible to show theoretical performance guarantees for UPGD? For instance, can the approximation error of equation 2 be bounded? Alternatively, if the true utilities are used in equation 3, is it possible to derive some guarantees against forgetting or loss of plasticity?

How much more significantly does UPGD improve upon baselines S-EWC and S-MAS?

9,Reviewer-3zCE,Addressing Loss of Plasticity and Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning,"Deep representation learning methods struggle with continual learning, suffering from both catastrophic forgetting of useful units and loss of plasticity, often due to rigid and unuseful units. While many methods address these two issues separately, only a few currently deal with both simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce Utility-based Perturbed Gradient Descent (UPGD) as a novel approach for the continual learning of representations. UPGD combines gradient updates with perturbations, where it applies smaller modifications to more useful units, protecting them from forgetting, and larger modifications to less useful units, rejuvenating their plasticity. We use a challenging streaming learning setup where continual learning problems have hundreds of non-stationarities and unknown task boundaries. We show that many existing methods suffer from at least one of the issues, predominantly manifested by their decreasing accuracy over tasks. On the other hand, UPGD continues to improve performance and surpasses or is competitive with all methods in all problems. Finally, in extended reinforcement learning experiments with PPO, we show that while Adam exhibits a performance drop after initial learning, UPGD avoids it by addressing both continual learning issues.","This work proposes to modify stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to overcome forgetting and promote plasticity in continual learning. These goals are achieved by masking out the parameters with high utility and perturbing gradient direction by Gaussian noise. For utility computation, the authors propose an approximate but efficient scheme based on second-order Taylor expansion of the loss. Experiments demonstrate that (i) the proposed utility approximation is more accurate than simple baselines such as weight magnitude, (ii) it maintains plasticity, (iii) plasticity and accuracy are in general correlated, (iv) the method tends to forget less than baselines, and (v) it simultaneously promote plasticity and prevents forgetting. This paper is written well. The notation is okay and the mathematical derivations seem correct. The baseline methods are clearly outperformed and the experiments verify the central claim of the paper. Although continual learning is an important machine learning challenge, I feel the paper suffers from significant weaknesses:

  - First and foremost, I do not think this paper makes a significant contribution. The methodology is incremental in that it combines two well-known ideas (perturbed gradient descent + keeping active neurons unchanged). 
  - Second, it is tested on very toy setups. The experiments are not convincing enough to show the applicability of the method to interesting real-world setups. For instance, I am not sure the networks achieve similar plasticity if tested on, e.g., webcam data instead of MNIST, where the feature space is a lot richer and hence plasticity is much more difficult.
  - Third, theoretical properties/implications of the method should be carefully examined. 
    - For instance, the Taylor expansion would only hold if $W_{l,i,j}$ are infinitesimally small. We do not know in general if this holds or not. I suggest the paper should include a (preferably rigorous) discussion on this.
    - Likewise, gradient descent is no longer steepest descent but some approximation to it. Investigating why it works is important. As shown by the results, no collapse occurs but again, I wonder how this translates into more challenging settings where utilities of most parameters are high. Here I list my questions as well as suggestions:

- It would be better if Label-Permuted EMNIST was described before the results are discussed in paragraph 5.
- _Although a few methods address both issues simultaneously, such methods expect known task boundaries, maintain a replay buffer, or require pretraining, which does not fit streaming learning._ <--- reference needed for this claim.
- What does ""a Hessian diagonal approximation in linear complexity"" mean? Linear in the number of parameters?
- It would be better if the main text included details on the ""utility propagation theorem"".
- It would be better if the descriptions of the tasks/datasets (e.g. Input-Permuted MNIST in section 4.2) were given before the details.
- Does ""each learner is trained for 1M samples, one sample each time step"" mean gradient descent using one sample only?

A modification to the vanilla gradient descent update rule that helps the model to operate in a more challenging scenario of streaming learning. The authors introduced their utility function as an importance weight for each parameter of a neural network. The authors show the effectiveness of their contribution compared to common importance assignment methods in the continual learning literature. **Clear Structure and Writing:** The paper benefits from a clear structure and concise writing style.

**Addressing a Complex Issue:** The authors tackle an underexplored yet challenging problem, and I appreciate their efforts to address online continual learning.

**Mathematical Foundation:** The definition of utility introduced in the paper is based on simple and sound mathematical derivations. 

**New metric:** The introduction of a new plasticity metric is a nice contribution to the relatively uncharted territory of streaming learning. **Unscaled perturbations:** My main point of issue is the reasoning behind the perturbations in the update rule. The authors claim that by adding the perturbation we are making the unimportant weights more plastic however I am not really convinced by this explanation I believe it requires elaboration both in the rebuttal and in the paper. 

Another related issue with the proposed perturbation is the fact that all of them are getting drawn from the same standard normal distribution. This design choice is strange to me since the parameters of a neural network usually differ in magnitude from layer to layer. By adding an unscaled random perturbation to all of the weights we are ignoring this scale difference which I believe is sub-optimal. I know that in the unprotected version, they are getting weighted by different values but this particular scaling is more correlating with changes in the loss value rather than the parameter magnitudes.

Highly relevant to the above issue, I believe it is also necessary to have an additional ablation study, investigating the role of having and not having the perturbations in the update rule. I also want to disentangle the effect of weight decay. The only time that UG is added in the ablation is in the presence of WD. More specifically I am curious about the following scenarios in Figure 8: 

* Added ablations:
    + SGD + UG + WP + WD (present in the paper)
    + SGD + UG + WP 
    + SGD + UG + WD
    + SGD + UG

    
**Including more diverse experiments:** Moreover, in the experiments section I believe the authors need to include more diverse experiments. All of the streaming tasks are permutations of the same task. Whether in the label or in the input space. It is not as obvious as the authors' claim that after the permutation of the input space the previously learned representations are not relevant anymore (end of page 6). In the input-permuted scenario, only the first layer needs to have significant change. This is especially true for the label-permuted tasks as the network does a good job of clustering the data up to the final FC layer. I encourage the authors to use the Cifar100 superclass dataset (or any similar sequence of tasks that does not simply rely on the permutation).

**Visualization:** Finally, I believe the visualization needs several improvements: the legends on the plot are very hard to read (Fig 2, 3, 4, 5). Some colors are similar to each other and the width of the lines in the legends is too thin. (Especially in figure 4). In Figure 7, some numbers in dark blue cells are almost impossible to read. **Q1:** Have the authors tried to use an scaled version of the perturbation that takes the magnitude of the parameters into account? (Other than the unprotected version). Also I would appreciate the if you could elaborate on the effect of perturbations.

**Q2:** Could you also explain about the average online accuracy? it is stated that ""The average online accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions within each task."" I cannot see the average part here. Is it calculating the accuracy on each task separately then averaging over the number of tasks?",679,0,0,0.7295,0.0576258913,0.915908277,59,42.2021,0.929,iclr,0.0,4,4,5,4,factual,4,4,88,neutral,4,neutral,4,low,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,90,polite,5,neutral,5,low,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,factual,4.0,4.0,80.0,polite,5.0,positive,3.0,none,4,4,4,4,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,positive,4,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low

77,Houcemeddine-Turki,Fact Checking in Knowledge Graphs by Logical Consistency,"Misinformation spreads across media, community, and knowledge graphs in the Web by not only human agents but also information extraction systems that automatically extract factual statements from unstructured textual data to populate existing knowledge graphs. Traditional fact checking by experts is increasingly difficult to keep pace with the volume of newly created information in the Web. Therefore, it is important and necessary to enhance the computational ability to determine whether a given factual statement is truthful or not. In this paper, our goal is to 1) mine weighted logical rules from a knowledge graph, 2) to find positive and negative evidential paths in a knowledge graph for a given factual statement by the mined rules, and 3) to calculate a truth score for a given statement by an unsupervised ensemble of the found evidential paths. For example, we can determine the statement ""The United States is the birth place of Barack Obama"" as truthful since there is the positive evidential path (Barack Obama, birthPlace, Hawaii) ∧ (Hawaii, country, United States) in a knowledge graph, and it is logically consistent with the given statement. On the contrary, we can determine the factual statement ""Canada is the nationality of Barack Obama"" as untruthful since there is the negative evidential path (Barack Obama, birthPlace, Hawaii) ∧ (Hawaii, country, United States) ∧ (United States, ≠ , Canada) in a knowledge graph, and it is logically contradictory to the given statement. For evaluation, we constructed a novel evaluation dataset by labeling true or false labels on the factual statements extracted from Wikipedia texts by the state-of-the-art BERT-based relation extractor. Our evaluation results show that the proposed weighted logical rule-based approach outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches significantly by up to 0.12 AUC-ROC, and even outperforms the supervised approach by up to 0.05 AUC-ROC not only in our dataset but also in the two publicly available datasets. The source code and evaluation dataset proposed in this paper is open-source and available at https://github.com/machinereading/KV-rule and https://github.com/machinereading/KV-eval-dataset each.","This manuscript presents a novel rule-based approach for fact checking in knowledge graphs based on mining textual resources. The work provides new evidences that rule-based approaches can provide more precise evaluation of the accuracy of statements in knowledge graphs and can enhance the efficiency of embedding-based methods when combined with them. The availability of source codes and datasets in GitHub is an advantage for this work as this will allow the reproducibility of the described experimental study. However, there are several matters within the paper that should be addressed to ameliorate its final output: (i) Introduction: The ""Introduction"" seems to be a summary of ""Related Studies in Fact Checking"" rather than a proper introduction and contextualization of the paper. I propose to expand the part about misinformation fighting in the introduction to give better context for the development of this research paper. The authors can benefit from previous research papers about fact checking in general to develop the introduction of the paper. Several points in the introduction should be moved to Related Studies in Fact Checking. (ii) The paper did not emphasize the advantages of rule-based approaches when compared to embedding-based methods beyond having a better precision. Effectively, there are many other advantages of rule-based approaches. For example, the results of rule-based approaches can be more explainable than the ones of embedding-based approaches. Such advantages should be expanded and highlighted in the research paper. (iii) The paper did not emphasize the importance of having the datasets and source codes available in a specific GitHub repository. The authors should specify that this practice allows reproducibility and further development of the work by peers, particularly in the conclusion. (iv) The paper did not discuss the concept of reification in knowledge graphs. Effectively, several knowledge graphs add qualifiers to triples to provide a characteristic of the statements (i.e. {(s,p,o), p, o}. The authors should discuss the usefulness of the method to verify the qualifiers of the statements in the Discussion or as a future direction for this work. (v) The paper should evocate the robustness of the rule-based approach they proposed to adversarial attacks. This can be an advantage of the approach. (vi) There are several typos in the research paper (e.g. ""UC Berkely"" should be ""UC Berkeley""). The authors should proofreading the paper to eliminate such deficiencies.

Incorporating higher order many-body interactions can enhance the expressiveness and accuracy of models. Recent models have achieved this by explicitly including up to four-body interactions. However, five-body interactions, which have relevance in various fields, are still challenging to incorporate efficiently into MLFFs. In this work, we propose the quintuple network (QuinNet), an end-to-end graph neural network that efficiently expresses many-body interactions up to five-body interactions with \emph{ab initio} accuracy. By analyzing the topology of diverse many-body interactions, we design the model architecture to efficiently and explicitly represent these interactions. We evaluate QuinNet on public datasets of small molecules, such as MD17 and its revised version, and show that it is compatible with other state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks. Moreover, QuinNet surpasses many leading models on larger and more complex molecular systems, such as MD22 and Chignolin, without increasing the computational complexity.

We open source our implementation at https://github.com/Zun-Wang/QuinNet.","The paper introduces a new method for molecular modeling, QuinNet, which incorporates five-body interactions using only dihedral angles. The authors first introduce relevant concepts related to machine learning force fields and related work in the field related to a variety of equivariant models. Next, the paper describes pertinent definitions of force fields, group equivariance, and methods for calculating empirical force fields. In the methods section, the authors describe their approach for integrating five-body terms into the architecture of QuiNet using only dihedral angles and incorporating model designs from prior work (PaiNN for 3-body interactions, ViSNet for 4-body interactions) and new definitions for different topologies of 5-body interactions. In addition to the architectural description, the authors provide relevant mathematical formulations and a complexity analysis. In their results, the authors showcase QuiNets performance on a low (MD17) and high complexity (MD-22) dataset in terms of energy and force modeling, including an ablation for different body terms in Figure 5. The paper has the following strengths:
* Originality: The proposed architecture incorporates relevant terms for molecular modeling that are physically relevant, but have not been incorporated before.
* Quality: The method and experimental design showcase relevant cases for applying GNN models for molecular modeling with the idea behind the architecture being well-motivated.
* Clarity: The paper presents a cohesive formulation of their method, both in figures and mathematics, and experiment descriptions with relevant takeaways.
* Significance: The proposed architecture shows improved modeling performance, especially in forces, and provides a potential framework for incorporating physical interactions into GNNs. The paper could be improved by the following:
* Providing a clear and concise discussion of limitations. \[Quality, Significance\]
* Adding more context for the results in Figure 4. The MD simulations are only briefly described in Section 5.1, which is on a different page then the figure and easy to miss. \[Clarity\]
* A description of the case in which a greater set of many-body interactions is beneficial. This is briefly mentioned in the discussion between MD17 and MD22, but it would be good to put in greater context in terms of the experimental results and could serve as part of the conclusion. \[Clarity\] * Could you provide additional details on the limitations of QuinNet? E.g. Is it limited to modeling mainly molecular systems? What sizes of molecules do you think QuinNet can be effective in and why?
* Do you have data that supports your compute complexity analysis compared to other methods? If so, what kind of speedup do you generally find, if any?

To efficiently incorporate such high-order information, the authors are motivated by the topology of many-body interactions and design sophisticated components. Experiments on several benchmarks are conducted to demonstrate the performance of QuinNet. 1. The target problem of this paper, the development of machine learning force field models, is of great significance. 1. **The motivation for the designed components of many-body interaction is puzzling**. As introduced in Section 4, the development of four-body interaction (improper torsions) and five-body interactions are based on the topology. First, such analysis is purely qualitative. The authors did not provide further completeness proof or quantitative evidence about these interaction schemes in real-world data. Second, the reasons for deriving Eq (4)-(9) are not well explained. It is suggested to clarify how these components are motivated according to the topology analysis.


2. **On the experimental evaluation**. Additionally, there are several aspects of the experiments that are concerned:
    - The empirical performance is not consistently better than other baselines. Among the evaluated benchmarks, the proposed QuinNet cannot outperform the baselines significantly. For example, in MD17, the newly developed five-body interaction modules do not significantly improve performance. In rMD17, the best performance is diversely distributed among the compared models. Overall, the experimental evaluation does not well demonstrate the power of newly developed modules.
    - The computation efficiency evaluation is missing. Although the authors provide complexity analysis, it is better to further show the time/memory cost comparison between the proposed QuinNet and baselines. Besides, the model parameters should also be provided for all compared models.
    - The scale of the chosen benchmarks is rather small. Both the dataset size and sample size (number of atoms) are limited. It is suggested to further evaluate the proposed QuinNet on large-scale benchmarks, e.g., Open Catalyst Project \[1\].
    - The ablation study. First, as shown in Figure 5, the inclusion of Five-body@I even induces further errors, which would make readers curious about whether such a phenomenon generally exists. Second, as introduced in VisNet, the improper angle was also considered. The authors should add further discussions and empirical comparisons between it and the newly proposed four-body interaction (improper torsion).


3. **The writing does not meet the requirement of an acceptable paper in this conference**. First, Section 3.2 can be thoroughly extended (e.g., in the appendix) to introduce the background of force fields and highlight the importance of torsion potential, improper torsions, and higher-order many-body interactions. Second, there lack of formal descriptions of QuinNet. Figure 3 can hardly be understood by readers that are not familiar with the related works in this area.

They first analyze the topology of 5-body interactions and identify three 5-body angles. Then they propose an efficient way to incorporate these 5-body information into models. The complexity of the proposed QuinNet is still O(|N|), the same as many previous 2-body methods like PaiNN. The results are comparable to previous SOTA methods. This paper is well-written and easy to follow.

The experimental results show that the proposed method can perform well on most tasks. The ablation study in Section 5.4 and Figure 5 show that the proposed 5-body information indeed helps to model. See details in the Question part. 1. About the motivation:   
 this paper aims to incorporate 5-body interactions into geometric deep learning models. However, based on my understanding, using up to 4-body (torsions) interaction is already complete \[1\]\[2\] in terms of capturing the geometric structures. If this is correct, then why do we need these 5-body angles? In addition, if we can incorporate 5-body interactions, do we also need to incorporate 6-body interactions?

2. About the complexity:   
in Section 4.3, the authors claim that the complexity is O(|N|), as efficient as many 2-body methods like SchNet and PaiNN. But I think this complexity is not well explained. Using pseudocode/algorithm may be better to analyze the complexity. In addition to the analysis, I suggest the authors use some results to empirically verify the great efficiency compared to other baseline methods, e.g. the inference time, used memory, etc.

3. About the tasks:   
this paper focuses on MLFFs, how about other molecular property prediction tasks, such as QM9 and OC20? I am wondering if this method is specially designed for MLFFs, or can be used on all 3D molecule tasks. In other words, why do the authors emphasize MLFFs? Is there any significant difference between MLFFs and other molecule property prediction tasks?

The authors evaluate the model on a couple of public datasets and show demonstrate the competence or superiority of this new model compared to the state of the art in this field. The paper provides an important addition to a series of ever-improving machine learning potentials.  The contribution is clear and simple to understand at the high level, though the details are often unclear.  The benchmarks were compared against a set of reasonably strong published methods in this area.  In my opinion, if this work was presented in an unambiguously clear fashion and accompanied by code, it could be a strong contribution to this conference.  

\[The paper improved significantly following the first round of feedback from reviewers, so I'm raising my rating to a 7.\] The complexity analysis is very limited.  How many total interactions did the typical molecule have as a function of their atoms, and how did the practical experimental complexity scale for the evaluation of these molecules.  One of the main reasons that 5-body terms were not used in traditional MD simulations was the poor scaling of the number of interactions one would need to calculate.

The MD simulation mentioned in section 5.1 and Fig 4 are not described anywhere.  The following sentences suggest that there would be some explanations in the supplement, but I couldn't find them: ""Additionally, we perform MD simulations using trained QuinNets as force fields and plot the distribution of interatomic distances h(r) for these 7 molecules in Fig. 4. Further details regarding additional settings can be found in the Supplementary Materials."" 

These sentences in the supplement, page2, are confusing or wrong: ""Similarly, five-body@III interaction (Fig. S1 (c)) is a special case of six-body interaction when nodes i and k4 in Fig. S1 (d) superpose each other. Thus, the QuinNet model captures all five-body interactions and a portion of six-body interactions, making it a versatile and comprehensive tool for modeling complex molecular systems.""  There is no six-body interaction if two of the bodies are the same, and there is no physically acceptable case where two different atoms could superpose each other.

The code is not provided, so it is not possible for me to assess the reproducibility of this method.  The diagram in Figure 3 seems reasonable at the very high level, but it lacks the definitions of most of the terms annotated in the figure, thus rendering it confusing.  (What is $Y_l$? is it the set of all spherical harmonics $Y_{lm}$ for a given angular momentum $l$? What is $n_j$? What is $s_j$?  $W$?...)

187,Reviewer-yUvs,Unsupervised Feature Selection using a Basis of Feature Space and Self-Representation Learning,"In recent years, there has been extensive research into unsupervised feature selection methods based on self-representation.
However, there exists a major gap in the mathematical principles that underlie these approaches and their capacity to represent the feature space.
In this paper, a novel representation learning method, Graph Regularized Self-Representation and Sparse Subspace Learning (GRSSLFS), is proposed for the unsupervised feature selection.
Firstly, GRSSLFS expresses the self-representation problem based on the concept of ``a basis of feature space'' to represent the original feature space as a low-dimensional space made of linearly independent features. Furthermore, the manifold structure corresponding to the newly constructed subspace is learned in order to preserve the geometric structure of the feature vectors. Secondly, the objective function of GRSSLFS is developed based on a self-representation framework that combines subspace learning and matrix factorization of the basis matrix. Finally, the effectiveness of GRSSLFS is explored through experiments on widely-used datasets. Results show that GRSSLFS achieves a high level of performance in comparison with several classic and state-of-the-art feature selection methods.","Authors of this paper propose graph regularized self-representation and sparse subspace learning (GRSSLFS) for unsupervised feature selection. The basis extension method is modified to select bases with highest variance score. These bases are used to build graph regularized self-representation learning and subspace learning. The graph regularized self-presentation learning and subspace learning are combined in terms of a set of selected bases from input space with the highest variance score. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method comparing with baselines. The ablation study also shows the necessity of each component. The subspace learning module is the key component, but its derivation from selected bases highly relies on the assumption that XU=B. This might not be hold if B is selected according to the proposed variance basis extension method. Moreover, the selection based on subspace learning module lacks of convincing explanation since G does not exactly represent X based on B as a fixed set of feature vectors. It is confusing to explain (4) as the self-representation problem if B is arbitrary basis matrix since they may not come from the input data matrix X.  Taking PCA for example, the columns of B are orthogonal, but they are not from the input feature space. Moreover, B defined as a square matrix of size m is inconsistent with the sleeted r bases in section 3.3.

In section 3.1, authors mentioned that two features have a similar structure in the feature space, and it is expected Bg_l and Bg_r have similar structure. What does the similar structure mean? How is the similarity measured? In other words, it is unclear how the matrix A is constructed. 

The derivation in section 3.2 depends on the assumption that XU=B. As B is a set of feature vectors selected from input data, it is unclear whether the assumption still holds or not. Similarly for Theorem 3.1, it is trivial to have if the assumption holds. 

The variance basis extension is to simply change the selection order of feature vectors in terms of variance score of feature vectors. It is possible that for each individual feature, the variance is high, but is it similar to say the largest amount of data dispersion? 

For completeness, authors should describe the derivation process on how equations (9)-(11) are obtained. Since all three equations are fractional, is it possible that any of the denominators can be zero? How is it handled?

In Algorithm 1, the selected features are derived from U. However, U is not directly related to the input X instead to B and G, unless BG=X. However, B is selected feature vectors from input space. It is unclear why the assumption can hold. So why is the selection rule proper?

The computation complexity is quite high since it is quadratic to both the number of samples and the number of features comparing with most of baseline methods.
The application to the PneumoniaMNIST dataset is quite interesting. However, the way of presenting the outcomes can be improved significantly.  For example, what is the interested region? how many selected features are in the interested region? How do other compared methods perform? The validation is not quantified. How many radiologists are involved in the evaluation?  What is the performance measured?

187,Reviewer-PMap,Unsupervised Feature Selection using a Basis of Feature Space and Self-Representation Learning,"In recent years, there has been extensive research into unsupervised feature selection methods based on self-representation.
However, there exists a major gap in the mathematical principles that underlie these approaches and their capacity to represent the feature space.
In this paper, a novel representation learning method, Graph Regularized Self-Representation and Sparse Subspace Learning (GRSSLFS), is proposed for the unsupervised feature selection.
Firstly, GRSSLFS expresses the self-representation problem based on the concept of ``a basis of feature space'' to represent the original feature space as a low-dimensional space made of linearly independent features. Furthermore, the manifold structure corresponding to the newly constructed subspace is learned in order to preserve the geometric structure of the feature vectors. Secondly, the objective function of GRSSLFS is developed based on a self-representation framework that combines subspace learning and matrix factorization of the basis matrix. Finally, the effectiveness of GRSSLFS is explored through experiments on widely-used datasets. Results show that GRSSLFS achieves a high level of performance in comparison with several classic and state-of-the-art feature selection methods.","Considering there exists a major gap in the mathematical principles that underlie the self-representation based unsupervised feature selection approaches and their capacity to represent the feature space, this paper proposes Graph Regularized Self-Representation and Sparse Subspace Learning (GRSSLFS), for the unsupervised feature selection, which expresses the self-representation problem based on the concept of “a basis of feature space” to represent the original feature space as a low-dimensional space made of linearly independent features.

A major differentiator from symbolic approaches is the idea that these state abstractions should be continuous rather than discrete. The key assumption is that you are given a set of options and a dataset obtained by rolling them out. Experiments are conducted in a few simple domains: pinball and antmaze, and demonstrate that the learned abstractions are sensible. The paper addresses an important topic (abstraction learning) and I appreciate the theoretically motivated algorithms. This line of work is of great interest to many attendees of ICLR. I also appreciate that the authors were clear about wanting continuous representations right off-the-bat. The math is also correct as far as I was able to tell, though I didn't check the proofs in the appendix in careful detail. Unfortunately, I recommend rejection for this paper due to 4 major reasons: 1) unconvincing experiments, 2) missing key citations to related work, 3) issues in technical details, and 4) unclear motivation.

1) unconvincing experiments

The experiments in this paper are very basic and only serve as a simple proof-of-concept that the learned abstractions are somewhat useful. To really scale up the experiments to the level expected for a conference paper, I would expect to see evidence that the learned abstractions are useful in more hierarchical domains (e.g., classic domains from the options literature like keys and doors). In such domains, we could test whether the value-preserving property holds empirically, by comparing the values from planning under the abstract model to the (ground truth) values from planning under the true model.

Additionally, I would like to see comparisons to many more RL algorithms, especially hierarchical ones like HIRO (https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08296), HVF (https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05829), and Director (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04114). This is because at the end of the day, the authors are proposing to learn a state encoder $\phi$, and despite all the theory that has gone into their algorithm, the question that must be answered is whether this $\phi$ outperforms the encoders learned by all these other SOTA hierarchical RL algorithms.

2) missing key citations to related work

The authors are missing several key citations, the most important of which is the line of work by David Abel, such as ""Near optimal behavior via approximate state abstraction"" (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/abel16.html) and ""Value preserving state-action abstractions"" (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/abel20a/abel20a.pdf). Those papers have very similar theory to what appears in this one, and so the novelty of the proposed approach is unclear. There are also less-famous but still important-to-cite papers from other authors, like ""Abstract value iteration for hierarchical reinforcement learning"" (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/jothimurugan21a/jothimurugan21a.pdf) and ""Deciding what to model: Value-equivalent sampling for reinforcement learning"" (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/3b18d368150474ac6fc9bb665d3eb3da-Abstract-Conference.html). It is important for the authors to contextualize the contributions of this paper against all these related works.

3) issues in technical details

The authors say in Section 3.2 that when B = \bar{B}, ""then simulating a trajectory in the abstract model is the same as in the ground model"". But I don't think this is true, because we need the rewards to match between the two trajectories too, and $B_t$ says nothing about rewards, only dynamics. The authors go on to say: ""Therefore, planning in the abstract model is accurate, in the sense, that the value of an abstract state z computed in the abstract model is the same as the one would get from trajectories from the ground MDP for the abstraction operator G."" Again, I think this is wrong because it ignores the abstract reward function, which could be arbitrarily different from the ground one. In fact, in the proof of corollary 3.8, the authors assume $E_{s \sim G(\cdot \mid z)}\[R(s, o)\] = \bar{R}(z, o)$, and it's only _under this assumption_ that the claims hold. But combining this assumption on reward function with Definition 3.6 ends us back up at the bisimulation conditions, and then it's not clear what the contributions of this paper are.
 
As a separate point, the second term in the mutual information expression of Section 4.2, $MI(S'; Z, A)$, seems very extreme! It is saying that you have to be able to predict the entire ground next state from the current abstract state and action. Doesn't this means the abstraction can't lose any information? This seems like an important technical limitation of the approach.

4) unclear motivation

The authors often state that a discrete abstract state space is bad, when pointing to work on symbolic abstraction learning (e.g., PDDL). But it's not clear why this is really bad. The authors say discrete abstract states are ""not applicable when planning with the available high-level actions requires a continuous state representation"", but this doesn't make sense to me, as the options have to act in the ground environment states, not in the abstract state space, and so the options could be defined with respect to either a discrete or a continuous abstract state space. Furthermore, it can be much easier to plan in a discrete abstraction (e.g., using powerful symbolic planners).

I believe a fruitful research direction would be to compare the abstractions learned by a symbolic approach against the abstractions learned by a continuous approach (like the authors'). Questions:
* Not much is said about the dataset $\mathcal{D}$, but intuitively, it has to be ""good"" in order for the learned state abstraction to be reasonable. In particular, the agent must see all the options being executed in a variety of settings, and obtain good coverage over the state-action space. Are there any concrete statements we can make about what properties we need this dataset to have?
* ""we must build a model of its effect"" Do you mean to say ""of the effect of each option""?
* ""with mean value equal to that by planning with the original MDP"" What is the mean over?
* Why did we switch from using O (denoting the option set) everywhere to using A throughout Section 4? Shouldn't we continue to use O, unless I am misunderstanding something?
* Section 4.3: Why should there be any cost/reward associated with executing skills? Shouldn't a sparse reward for reaching the goal be enough?
* Eq 2: What are the ""I"" random variables inside the mutual information expression referring to?

Minor edits:
* ""make the same decision"" To clarify, we just need that the policy maps all states in z to the same action distribution. A stochastic policy isn't really committing to a ""decision"" about what action to take.
* ""Abstractions alleviate this tension: action abstractions enable agents to plan at larger temporal scales and state abstractions reduce the complexity of learning and planning"" I would say that both of them do both of these. Action abstractions certainly reduce the complexity of planning, which is typically exponential in the branching factor.
* ""learns a further abstraction"" --> ""learn a further abstraction""
* ""otherwise it is referred as learning"" I would say ""policy learning"" to distinguish from other things you might learn
* ""when it is the given position"" --> ""when it is in the given position""
* ""referred as learning"" --> ""referred to as learning""
* ""results a bounded value loss"" --> ""results in a bounded value loss""
* In definition 3.5, the authors use $s_o$ in a few places where they mean $s_0$.",1210,7,0,0.7753,0.0567315252,0.9024221301,49,44.7468,0.6075,iclr,0.0196078431372549,5,5,5,5,factual,5,4,94,polite,4,negative,5,none,5,5,5,5,factual,5,5,90,polite,5,negative,5,none,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,factual,4.0,3.0,60.0,neutral,5.0,negative,5.0,low,5,5,5,5,factual,5,5,95,polite,5,negative,5,none,3,4,4,3,partially factual,4,3,70,neutral,5,negative,5,low

Given a set of high-level skills and the learned dynamics preserving abstractions, the paper claims to develop an approach for planning for a solution. 

The approach is evaluated in two test domains where the paper shows the visualization of the learned abstractions. - For the most part of the paper, it is extremely well written. Given the wide use of embodied AI systems and robots, an approach that generates plannable abstractions for high-dimensional sensor input is extremely important. 

- The paper nicely motivates the problem. While the paper in general is nicely written, it has a few limitations: 

- The paper advocates learning a continuous abstract  representation instead of a symbolic abstractions. However, it does not provide any reasons to that. Why are continuous abstractions more desirable than symbolic abstractions? 

- Sec 4.1 is unclear. The notation for MI is a bit unclear. It needs to be made more clear. Sec 4.1 requires a re-writing including more explanation for the equation. I have two important questions: 

- How is the dynamics preserving abstraction defined in Def. 3.6 different from the Markovian abstractions defined in \[Srivastava et al. 2016\]? 

- Can you discuss the differences between the presented approach and \[Allen et al. 2021\]

- writing: 
Define the abbreviations before using them, e.g. ""PDDL"", ""VAE""

There is a chance that I have not fully understood what this paper is trying to present. 1- What is $P(s'|s,o)$ used in the paragraph right after definition 3.1?

2- An option $o$ is defined, and then you mention $T(s'|s,o)$ to define the transition probability of taking option $o$ in $s$? $T$ earlier was defined on action space $A$. How is it applied on options without showing the relationship of $I_o$ and $\beta_o$ with $s$ and $s'$ under option policy $\pi_o$?

3-the paper has defined ""$\bar {\gamma} = \gamma ^{\tau (s,o)}$ is the abstract discount factor, $\tau: Z \times O \rightarrow \[0,\infty)$, which consists of contradictory phrases. How is ${\tau (s,o)}$ but defined as a function of abstract variables $Z$ instead of $S$? Not clear what $\tau$ is. If based on definition 3.1, it is the option's execution time starting from $s$ taking option $o$, it is not clear how in definition 3.2 it becomes a map from $Z$ and $O$ to a non-negative real.

4- What does definition 3.4 mean? $ \Pi = {\pi \in \Pi : \pi(·|s) = \pi (·|z) \forall s \in z}$ says the probability of taking actions/options in $s$ should be equivalent to the probability of taking actions/options in abstract states. Transitions of taking actions in states might take you to another state $s'$ inside the similar abstract state $z$. How can the policies used for both abstract states and states be equivalent? Unless you are just discretizing the continuous state spaces based on the optimal policies that are already given. Lots of interchangeable usage of symbols here.

### Minor questions and suggestions

* Figure 1 may want to explain why abstract state representations and options are helpful for planning and learning. However, Figure 1 does not seem to help understand the paper. To understand this figure, we first need to know about options and abstract state representations, and how they simplify planning.

* In Section 4.2, it is unclear whether $\mathcal{L}^T_{\theta, \phi}$ is used to update $f_\phi$ or not.

* For multi-goal experiments in the paper, using the same amount of environment steps for the abstract planning and the ground baseline would make it easier to understand how better or worse a method is.

* The appendix could be included in the main paper for easier navigation.

* What is the difference between Figure 7 and 8?

* Training the abstract planning method longer in Figure 7 and 8 would be helpful to see how it learns. Using different x-scales for two methods is okay but it would be better to have the same scale.

* Many minor typos in the paper.

The novelty of PatchSynth lies in its harmonious synthesis of patch understanding and generation, coupled with an advanced synthetic description generator. This innovative approach addresses the historical challenges of accurate patch representation and description generation, marking a significant stride in the PTP paradigm.
Importance:
The topic is of paramount importance as it addresses a critical need in software engineering for accurate patch representation and description, which are pivotal for collaborative development, systematic documentation, and rapid code review processes. By advancing the PTP paradigm, PatchSynth not only contributes to the academic discourse but also holds promise for practical applications in software development workflows.
The work achieves promising results. The paper doesn't elucidate how PatchSynth adapts to varying programming languages or codebases with differing coding standards and structures. This lack of demonstrated adaptability could limit its applicability across diverse software projects, potentially requiring additional tuning or re-training to maintain accuracy and effectiveness in different environments. 1. Given the advancements in PatchSynth for patch-text understanding and generation, how well does the model perform in a transfer learning scenario? Can PatchSynth be fine-tuned or adapted effectively to related tasks in software engineering or different programming languages?
2. Are there considerations or plans for deploying PatchSynth in real-world software development environments? How would the integration look like, and what kind of support or infrastructure would be required to ensure the model operates efficiently and securely in a production setting?",310,0,2,0.8356,0.1883953168,0.940164268,50,9.2899,0.068,iclr,0.0,4,4,4,4,factual,3,3,65,polite,4,neutral,3,low,4,5,4,4,factual,4,4,88,polite,5,positive,5,low,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,factual,4.0,4.0,80.0,polite,5.0,positive,5.0,none,3,5,4,3,factual,4,4,80,polite,5,positive,4,low,2,4,3,3,partially factual,3,4,75,polite,4,neutral,4,low
141,Reviewer-H6rR,PatchSynth: a Patch-Text Pre-trained Model,"In recent years, patch representation learning has emerged as a necessary research direction for exploiting the capabilities of machine learning in software generation. These representations have driven significant performance enhancements across a variety of tasks involving code changes. While the progress is undeniable, a common limitation among existing models is their specialization: they predominantly excel in either predictive tasks, such as security patch classification, or in generative tasks such as patch description generation. This dichotomy is further exacerbated by a prevalent dependency on potentially noisy data sources. Specifically, many models utilize patches integrated with Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) that, unfortunately, may contain parsing inaccuracies, thus acting as a suboptimal source of supervision. In response to these challenges, we introduce PATCHSYNTH, a novel pre-training framework for patches and natural language text. PATCHSYNTH deploys a triple-loss training strategy for (1) patch-description contrastive learning, which enables to separate patches and descriptions in the embedding space, (2) patch-description matching, which ensures that each patch is associated to its description in the embedding space, and (3) patch-description generation, which ensures that the patch embedding is effective for generation. These losses are implemented for joint learning to achieve good performance in both predictive and generative tasks involving patches. Empirical evaluations focusing on patch description generation, demonstrate that PATCHSYNTH sets new state of the art performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art in metrics like BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and Recall.","This paper tackles the problem of code patch representation learning -- how to represent edits on code to support downstream tasks like commit message generation, patch correctness assessment, etc. 

This paper proposes a pretraining framework, with triplet losses on text-code contrastive loss, text-code matching loss and text generation loss based on code patch. The pretraining data includes 90K pairs of code change and synthesized commit messages. 

On downstream task of commit message generation upon FIRA\[1\] dataset, PatchSynth showed performance gains over public & self-ablation baselines.

Unlike from previous approaches(CCRep\[1\], Cache\[2\]) where code change is encoded with two streams (code-before-change, code-after-change), this work encodes code change(patch) with a standard transformer on a single patch file (like git commit diff). This is inline with the general trend in LLMs community that ultimately LLMs should be able to understand and capture internal structure without explicitly modelling it.
2. This paper applies representation pretraining with triplet losses -- which is quite known in multimodal pretraining domain (BLIP\[3\], BLIP-2\[4\], etc) -- to code patch representation. It empirically showed that such pretraining is helpful for downstream task of commit message generation.

In ICML (pp. 19730–19742). PMLR. I have multiple major concerns on the paper based on its current form. The most concerning issues are:

1. The paper claims ""The core part of PATCHSYNTH lies a state-of-the-art synthetic description generator"" in multiple places (3rd paragraph of Introduction, 2nd contribution in last part of Introduction, Section 2.3). However, there is no details on this synthetic description generator. The only mention is Section 4.4 with just one line ""Capitalizing on benchmarks from seminal works\[1,2\], our dataset, primarily focused on Java samples includes 90,661 patches with their **attendant** descriptions""

    i. Are these **attendant** descriptions generated by the author but simply taken from \[1,2\]? If the latter, then claiming such synthetic description generation as a key feature in this paper is highly problematic.

2. The task of representation learning of code patch, defaultly assigns 1 vector for a code patch (w/ 1 or more edits), which is the case for all previous works including CC2Vec\[3\], CCRep\[4\], Cache\[5\]. However, PATCHSYNTH seems to encode the code patch to a sequence of vectors (Figure 1). 

    i. Such change needs explicit explanation and justification which authors have failed to deliver.

3. Missing LLM baselines: with code patch being encoded with a sequence of vectors, the authors should compare with code-aware LLMs like Code-llama, or WizardCoder, as they also encode code patch to a sequence of vectors. 
    
    i. As the recent code-aware LLMs have shown great abilities in general instruction following in coding-related tasks, a very timely baseline would be applying code-aware LLMs to the downstream task of commit message generation, with few-shot prompting or finetuning. 

    ii. A comparison of PATCHSYNTH vs code-aware LLMs would very helpful for the community to understand the edge and relevance of the proposed method in LLM era, which the authors have failed to deliver.

4. Only 1 downstream task evaluated: The authors claimed that the method is designed both for generative and discriminative tasks. However, the empirical experiments were only conducted on commit message generation. As the encoding changed from one vector to a sequence of vectors, it's important to show how can such encoding can be adapted to tackle retrieval or classification tasks. Also, to claim it as a pretrain model, the authors need to evaluate on multiple downstream datasets.

5. Fairness in comparison: 

    i. Is PATCHSYNTH firstly pretrained on 90K and then finetuned on 75K data of FIRA? If so, it's not so fair to compare PATCHSYNTH with CCRep and FIRA methods, as they are not trained on 90K pretraining data. For example, Is it possible to also pretrain CCRep with 90K data?

    ii. As mentioned in point 2, CCRep has a more compact encoding of 1 vector while PATCHSYNTH encodes to a sequence of vectors. It is thus not fair to compare without explicitly mentioning such differences.

6. Concerns on Pretraining:

    i. details of creating negative pairs: one common technique in contrastive training is hard-negative-mining. However, the authors didn't disclose how they create negative pairs

    ii. For vision-language representation learning, a large batch size (>= 512) and a large pool to select negative examples have been shown to be necessary. This paper mentions the batch size of 32, which seems pretty small. I will need more verification on ablation of 1) batch size, 2) negative example selection and 3) pretraining metrics to be convinced that such setting is adequate for code-text representation pretraining. 

7. Writing & formatting issues

    i. On page 8, the chart of Figure 2 is partially blocked by its top legend

    ii. On page 8, the paragraph for \[Performance cross different patch attention\] is repetitive: it repeats twice in introducing the numerical performance. Besides, I don't think it's a good idea to verbosely list down all numbers when they are clearly seen in Figure 2.

    iii. In Section 2.1, there's no mention on recent code aware LLMs like Code-LLaMA. 

    iv. In Section 2.3, there's no citation to any work. Besides, CCRep\[4\] doesn't have the gap mentioned in Section 2.3 as it can both do discriminative and generative tasks and it doesn't reply on AST information. So an explicit comparison to CCRep in Related Work should be present.

This paper is technically sound.
2. The extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The paper studies individual fairness and distributional fairness.

After relaxing common definitions for IF metrics by means of $\ell_\infty$ balls (or orthotopes), they adapt methodology based on adversarial robustness to provide upper and lower bounds to the IF achieved by models on an empirical sample - and those within a $\gamma-$Wasserstein ball about it. - This paper studies an important problem of individual fairness
- The first half of the paper, Section 3 and 4, which cover Background, the DIF definition, and problem explanation are very clear and easy to understand. - The key observation and novelty in the approach is not clearly noted (See below)
- Several of the nice advantages of their method (e.g efficiency) are not explained (see below). 1. Numerous times in the paper the authors say their bounds are ”efficient” because they leverage efficient methods (e.g. those based on bound propagation). While that may be true, it would be nice for the readers if they provided a brief explanation as to why these methods are efficient instead of placing everything in the appendix. 
2. It seems to me that the central novelty of this paper is to upper bound a mahalanobis metric (for $d_{fair}$) with an orthotope, which is quite simple. The remaining of the paper seems to me a direct application of results and methods in adversarial robustness. While I do appreciate the observation of being able to use those tools in the context of fairness - which also constitutes novelty - I would appreciate if the authors could be very clear about what are the main technical contributions of this work.
3. Personally, I am not sure providing a section on the impact of these methods on group fairness is necessary. I’d much rather prefer a discussion on the efficiency of the bounds.
4. Figure 1 is quite confusing. What makes the blue-star individuals likely? As presented, those blue-star points do not look likely. If I understand the figure correctly, the authors should present a more balanced empirical sample together with a larger sample representing the (unobserved) population. 
5. I also have problems with the fact that the authors state their goals and present their definitions in terms of expectation (e.g. as in Def 2), but simply restrict themselves to studying empirical samples. I think the presentation is misleading, because nowhere the authors really provide guarantees for the definition in Def 2 (that is, risk bounds). This is also an important limitation where the study the Wasserstein distance between distributions, as they simply regard their distribution as a one supported on Dirac functions (on the observed samples). 
6. Immediately after Eq (4), the authors write that “we can optimize this bound to be tight”. I don’t think this is correct: while they can indeed optimize the bound, there’s no guarantee that the bound will be tight, as the original problem is non-concave.
7. In Section 5.4 and after presenting $\mathcal L_{F-DIF}$, the authors mention when $\gamma=0$, one recovers a local constraint on individual fairness on $x\in X$. I don’t think this is completely accurate, because again, Def. 2 is defined in expectation of $x\sim p(x)$, not simply over the empirical sample. The authors mention that they do not foresee negative societal impacts. Maximizing upper and lower bounds is great but in doing so we don’t really know what is happening to the true fairness violation. It may be that the true fairness violation is in fact increasing which is propagating unfairness. While I understand that solving for this value is not feasible and thus appreciate the results presented, I would also like the paper to acknowledge that there are potential negative effects.",619,0,7,0.7891,0.1001929392,0.9119418859,215,46.7646,0.6521,neurips,0.0,5,5,5,5,factual,5,5,95,polite,5,neutral,5,none,4,4,4,4,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,moderate,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,partially factual,3.0,4.0,70.0,polite,4.0,neutral,3.0,low,4,4,4,4,factual,4,4,80,polite,5,neutral,5,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low

The focus is on studying how to certify distributional individual fairness (IF) (individual fairness over a set of distributions close to the observed empirical data distribution) in neural networks. Prior work has focused largely on certifying global IF, which is more expensive and thus can only be applied to smaller neural networks than the proposed certification/debiasing technique. The contributions of the paper are in showing how to certify distributional IF in neural networks and then using these bounds in the training process as regularizers to debias NNs. 

The main methodology for certifying IF is presented in Section 5. The first step is to certify local IF by over-approximating the similarity ball to find a conservative estimate of the IF violation. They can then use this bound to certify distributional IF around the empirical data distribution and apply finite sample guarantees to give an estimate of the true distributional IF. 

The authors then show how to use the bounds on distributional fairness as regularizers in the training procedure as a way to debias neural networks. They then provide experimental evaluation on a few benchmark datasets that demonstrates that their proposed training method indeed improves distributional individual fairness, at relatively modest degradations in accuracy.  The main advantage is a relatively lightweight way to certify and train NNs for IF, in a way that requires little additional computation, compared to previous methods which are not able to scale to large NNs. 

The experimental evaluation seems to confirm that DIF training as proposed by the regularization method does in fact improve significantly improve IF at modest degradation in classification accuracy.  Section 5 is a little dense and it would be helpful for the reader if there was a little more discussion of the optimization procedure, particularly in Section 5.3. Theorem statements here might also be helpful for the reader to understand what the final guarantees are.  What is the purpose of Table 2? It is a little difficult to interpret the punchline - it just seems to indicate that DIF training does not have a consistent effect on group fairness measures, either positively or negatively.  -",363,0,1,0.7939,0.0286027569,0.9569676518,215,26.5652,0.0354,neurips,0.0,4,4,3,3,factual,3,4,60,neutral,3,negative,4,high,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,85,5,5,neutral,5,moderate,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,factual,4.0,4.0,80.0,polite,5.0,neutral,3.0,none,3,4,4,3,factual,4,4,80,polite,5,positive,5,low,3,4,4,4,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,4,low

ConSpec learns a set of prototypes for the critical steps in a task by a novel contrastive loss and delivers an intrinsic reward when the current state matches one of the prototypes.

(ii) They do so in a readily interpretable manner, enabling out-of-distribution generalization when sensory features are altered. Distinct from other contemporary RL approaches to credit assignment, ConSpec takes advantage of the fact that it is easier to retrospectively identify the small set of steps that success is contingent upon (and ignoring other states) than it is to prospectively predict reward at every taken step.

ConSpec works by delivering intrinsic rewards when the current states match one of the prototypes. This paper also conducted experiments in various environments. The intuition of learning the critical states is natural and easy to follow. The experimental results in this paper look solid and promising. Despite the empirical performance, the reviewer finds the ConSpec algorithm itself hard to follow.

The largest weakness is: the insufficient discussion on how the prototypes $h_i$ are learned. Hence, the reviewer cannot understand the detailed on how $h_i$ are used (see detailed in Questions). 

Besides insufficient discussion on the prototypes, some minor issues are: (1) the title in the pdf (Contrastive Introspection:. ..) seems to mismatch with the one appear in openreview (ConSpec: …). (2) The font of citations appears to be confusing. E.g., from line 19-20 in the introduction, the manuscript uses (number) to address some key points, and the citation also appears as (number) – it would be nice if the citation can be changed to something that is not (number; number).
 Per the major weaknesses:
1. How are the prototypes $h_i$ actually learned? If the reviewer understands correctly, in line 7 of the abstract, the manuscript says “ConSpec learns a set of prototypes…”. While in Algorithm 1, it seems that the prototypes $h_i$ are given to the algorithm as inputs. Maybe the author can clarify why this inconsistency in learning the prototypes happens?
2. How are the $h_i$ learned/chosen in each experiment? The reviewer has looked into the detail of the experiments in the appendix, but cannot clearly understand how the presented experiments actually utilize the $h_i$. It would be nice that the authors can provide more details of all the $h_i$ in all the present experiments (Sec. 4.1-4.5).

While Bellman equation can theoretically do credit assignment over long-horizon, reward is hard to propagate under Bellman-based methods in practice. The authors therefore propose a novel algorithm that uses contrastive learning to identify critical states that final success relies on. The method uses a memory like system that can give agents intrinsic reward during training. The paper then evaluates the proposed method on a wide variety of domains and shows performance gain when the proposed method is added to RL algorithms.
 The paper is based on an interesting and important insight about long-horizon credit assignment and reward learning. The proposed method is designed to explicitly improve long-term credit assignment and have shown empirical success in the evaluation. 

The writing and figures are clear. The paper is easy to follow.

The evaluation covers a wide variety of RL tasks are benchmarked to back the claim of the paper.  1. The method assumes additional access to a ""success"" indicator at the end of episode. While this is commonly obtainable in gym environments, this doesn't fit into the general MDP setting and thus might limit when the algorithm can be applied. 

2. The assumption about access to ""success"" seems privileged compared to baselines. I am wondering they will catch up with the performance of the proposed method when a success bonus is added.

3. The evaluation has #mini batches / # gradient steps as x-axis, unlike the environment steps in common RL benchmarks. I am wondering why this is the case. If this is necessary, I'd like to see convincing justifications. 

4. The proposed method relies on a memory system, which may hurt generalization and might have problem when scaling up.

5. CURL+PPO doesn't seem to be a strong baseline to ablate in figure 3. I hope the authors could benchmark against RAD\[https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14990\], a much stronger baseline in pixel space.  I am wondering whether adding the intrinsic reward can degrade the performance of RL algorithms on common environments (aka, those environments where the final success does not depend on just a few critical steps). This shall be justified the experiments.

When the observation is partial, is the proposed method still reasonable?

 1. The method requires privileged information about success of an episode. 
2.

For new observations, the method then uses cosine similarity to the learned features as a reward bonus. The method is evaluated on a unity-based env, grid-worlds, versions of gym,atari envs with delayed rewards, and Montezuma’s revenge. 1. Effective exploration bonus

The idea of learning invariant features across successes, and using these as a source of reward does seem to give better exploration performance, from the experiments. The Montezuma’s revenge experiments (Fig,6) are particularly compelling - the baselines PPO, RIMS (which also uses a set of discrete slot-based learned features ) and Decision Transformer all fail to obtain any reward. By creating an explicit division between success and failure episodes, conspec can then learn features that match states present in the successes, but not the failures, even from a very small number of successful trajectories (There might be other, simpler ways to get this effect however, see weakness #1). The ability of con spec to find important states critical for the task is also investigated by the authors in the simpler unity-based env, where they also visualize states closest to the learned prototypes.  

2.   More expressive set for bottleneck states

Instead of learning an explicit set of states which are important (like sub-goals) as has been previously studied, this paper instead captures the notion of ‘critical states’ using learned prototypes. The advantage of this is it can flexibly capture a large set of very different states, all of which are critical. This is also beneficial because it enables zero-shot generalization in new environments (section 4.2)

3. Clarity, presentation

The paper is well motivated, written clearly, and the main idea for the algorithm is presented clearly. 1. Are the prototypes actually required?

Learning from data in successes that aren’t present in failures should lead to better performance, but the importance of doing this through learning prototype features is unclear. As a simple baseline, consider training a policy on only the successful set (using behavior cloning). Does this provide similar performance to con spec on Montezuma’s revenge? Is trying to capture a notion of ‘critical states’ required to learn better policies ? Can you run Decision Transformer where for each successful trajectory, every transition is labelled with a reward of 1, and for every failure trajectory, every transition is labelled with a reward of 0 ?

 2. Success/failure definition

The method relied crucially on the quality of the learned prototypes, which in turn depends on the success and failure datasets. It might not always be possible to divide up trajectories into 2 classes in this manner, in a lot of tasks performance keeps improving over time and a ‘successful’ trajectory at the beginning of training is very different from one from a converged policy. The authors do discuss this (appendix A.3), but the definition used in this paper for a successful trajectory is - ‘an episode that received one of the few rewards available, and a failure is defined as anything else’. For agents to keep learning and improving from data the notion of a success should necessarily change with time (eg - maximize the reward instead of just getting some reward). 

3. Delayed reward envs 

A good portion of the experiments are conducted on familiar gym, Atari envs but with a modification where the rewards are delayed. The significance of these experiments is unclear, since the delayed reward setting for these envs is not standard and widespread. Please address the questions in weakness #1.

ConSpec utilizes contrastive learning to learn prototypes of critical steps and employs a contrastive loss to differentiate successful and failed experiences. It addresses the challenges of long-term credit assignment and generalization in RL tasks. This article presents an interesting idea of learning to match key states in a task through contrastive learning. The writing of this paper is clear and Figure 1 is well-drawn, making it easy to quickly grasp the details of ConSpec. And the experimental results effectively demonstrate that the learned prototypes indeed match the key states in 3D Orange-Tree task and gridworld. The cosine similarity measures the similarity between the prototype and the hidden state, both of which are learnable vectors. However, optimizing the contrastive learning loss with updates to both vectors may lead to extremely unstable training. In related literature on representation learning, it is common to use the stop gradient approach and optimize only one of the learnable vectors. 
 - ConSpec achieved a return of only 400 in the Montezuma's Revenge task compared to RND, which reached a return of 7500 in its original paper. It appears that ConSpec is not as effective as RND in this regard. Both the multi-key room environment and Montezuma's Revenge involve similar logic, but the former is much simpler. So why does ConSpec outperform RND in Fig.4?
- It appears that ConSpec has significantly higher variance than the baseline algorithm in all tasks. What could be the reason for this? Further, prototype learning is crucial and can every seed match the key states?
- What does ""softmaxed over t"" mean in line 152? Why is it necessary to introduce softmax operation?
- How is success and failure defined in Atari and MuJoCo tasks? I think this is important, but the article lacks details in this aspect.

Testing, contact tracing, and isolation programs overwhelmed by SARS-CoV-2 could slow the spread of the new variants, which are still outnumbered by tracers in most countries. However, past failures and high rates of mistrust may lead health agencies to conclude that tracing is futile, dissuading them from redirecting existing tracers to focus on the new variants. Here we apply a branching-process model to estimate the effectiveness of implementing a variant-focused testing, contact tracing, and isolation strategy with realistic levels of performance. Our model indicates that bidirectional contact tracing can substantially slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants even in regions where a large fraction of the population refuses to cooperate with contact tracers or to abide by quarantine and isolation requests.","Approved With Reservations  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.  Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  This study considers the effectiveness of contact tracing focused on variants in reducing the reproduction number. Focusing contact tracing efforts on variants is an interesting approach and may be relevant to the current situation of variant circulations worldwide. The model and the analysis themselves seem well constructed and implemented. However, the authors’ analysis only focuses on a single variant essentially, and does not account for some important aspects that need to be considered to estimate the effect of real-world contact tracing in the presence of multiple variants. As a result, I am not sure if this study provides new insights that are distinct from existing studies on contact tracing for a single-pathogen outbreak. In addition, it should be noted that given a fixed capacity for contact tracing, the reduction in the reproduction number would not be permanent if the outbreak continues to grow. I believe these issues, along with other comments detailed below, need to be addressed for this study to be truly of epidemiological and public health interest. Major comments: Please clarify how this study is distinct from existing studies on contact tracing considering a single-pathogen outbreak (including the authors’ own study cited here).  There seems to be a mismatch between the study motivation/context and the modelling approach. One of the points the authors are trying to make is that the contact tracing efforts should be focused on variants because they are of more epidemiological importance (due to potentially higher transmission or immunoescape). I do not disagree with this point, but there are several major issues regarding how it was handled in the manuscript.  The reproduction number R is used as an objective variable to measure the effect of contact tracing. This is useful to connect interventions and the dynamic evolution of the epidemic, but essentially assumes that the same level of tracing can continue everywhere long-term, regardless of the epidemic size. This is obviously not true as the authors also state in the manuscript. In conditions where R is above 1, transmission of variants would continue and overwhelms the tracing capacity at some point, pushing R back to the original value eventually. Focusing on R may be useful in identifying conditions required to control the outbreak (i.e. R<1), but it is unrealistic to consider that the tracing can keep R lower than the original value in a long term if the resulting value exceeds 1.  Variants are no longer minor in many places now (see for example: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions), and I am not sure how much this assumption of ‘minor variants’ is relevant to the actual situation. Moreover, even in places where the variants are still minor, if the (effective) transmissibility of the variants is higher than the existing virus, they would rapidly replace the existing viruses, potentially in a few weeks/months. Exclusion of existing strains. The main argument regarding the tracing capacity is that the variants account for a small proportion of cases and thus can be handled if tracing focuses on these variants. However, even if such focused intervention is possible by tests that can distinguish variants, existing non-variant viruses may continue spreading if their R is above 1. Although such a situation may still have some benefit, e.g. if preventing the spread of immunoescaping variants would ensure the success of the vaccination program, such contexts should be clarified and discussed.  Cost and capacity. As discussed above, contact tracing would work as estimated here only until the capacity is reached. However, I feel efforts associated with tracing is not seriously considered in the analysis. For example, if all contacts of cases within the tracing period are traced, extending the tracing period from 2 days to 6 days would incur substantial additional effort for tracing. I believe it is important to discuss to what extent contact tracing might be sustainable for each setting because the presented results become invalid once the capacity is reached.  Given the points above, I would recommend the authors reconsider what outcome measure to use and how to present them; e.g. consideration of the growth of ""non-targeted"" viruses, conditions required to keep R below 1, whether tracing can “buy time” until achieving a sufficient level of vaccination before reaching the capacity, optimising the intensity of other NPIs (e.g. lockdowns) in the presence of contact tracing, etc., such that the results are relevant to what may actually happen. The Introduction looks lightweight and lacking necessary details or contexts. There are a lot of concepts that may not be familiar enough to every reader but are not sufficiently explained (e.g. TTI, backward contact tracing, bidirectional tracing, why TaqPath test can distinguish B.1.1.7… etc.) and thus may require a succinct clarification. Please also note that this paper may be read in 20 years from now, when the reader may not have the same level of recognition of the current situation. In this light, for example, I feel the first paragraph of Introduction may sound a bit abrupt to the reader who is less aware of the overall timeline of the pandemic. Also see some of the specific comments in the Minor comments section.  The Methods section is too simple and does not contain sufficient information for the reader to comprehend the overall structure of the analysis. Although it does not need to contain every technical detail of the model and analysis as the supplementary methods can be found in the repository (but please include a link and description in the paper so that the reader can easily find it), I feel more information from the supplementary methods should be extracted and summarised in the main text. For example, from the current Methods section I cannot interpret how the course of transmission was characterised, what is the assumed procedure of tracing (Is it always bidirectional tracing? I feel 2-day window is too short for backward tracing), how environmental transmission was assumed to work, how R was calculated, etc.  I believe additional sensitivity analysis would be necessary. For example, the overdispersion parameter (0.11 used in the current analysis) is estimated to be slightly higher (0.3-0.5) in some studies where interventions were in place (Adam et al., 20201). As the authors assume that interventions may be affecting R during contact tracing, possible changes in overdispersion should also be considered. Delay from secondary transmission to quarantine of contacts (defined as a sum of various delay distribution) would also affect the effectiveness of contact tracing in a nontrivial manner.  Is the effect of vaccines not considered, although as in Introduction it was one of the major motivation for considering controlling variants? Vaccines may affect different viruses similarly or differently, depending on the type of variants.  Supplementary Methods, “Identified contacts are quarantined, …isolated, tested, and traced as described above”: what is the difference between quarantining and isolation of traced contacts? Does this mean all traced contacts of a case are put under quarantine regardless of their true infection status, but only tested if they are symptomatic (which changes the label from quarantine to isolation)? If so, it is expected that as the epidemic grows there would be a substantial number of quarantined individuals, and at some point this might be impossible (e.g. due to depletion of essential workers) and the Reff control could collapse.  Minor comments: Throughout: please spell out acronyms at their first appearance, including SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.  Introduction, protection against B.1.351 and P.1: now the evidence is not limited to in-vitro studies (e.g. Madhi et al., 20212 and Kustin et al., 20213). Please update and include clinical findings. Also summarise what we know about protection against B.1.1.7.  “All three variants share…; B.1.1.7 can also be…”: I would suggest that the authors first describe B.1.1.7 that can be detected by TaqPath tests (with some more background context, as this is primarily happening in UK and not necessarily recognized by the wider audience) and then go on to a discussion of potential detectability of other variants (because this is only a hypothetical scenario so far in my understanding, as opposed to detection of B.1.1.7). Also, would there be any data on the rollout of these variant-distinguishable tests worldwide?  “Samples testing positive…”: This needs more context. Why is authorisation going to be an issue and why can re-screening bypass it?  “as is true for SARS-CoV-2 – but not yet the variants – in many regions”: I feel this is unclear. TTI capacity would be overwhelmed when the overall caseloads are high, even if the variants account for a very small fraction of them. It should be made clear if this indicates contact tracing would only target variants distinguished by the (variant-specific) tests.  Method, “child cases” may be interpreted as cases that are children. Secondary transmissions?  Results, “In the absence of contact tracing, identification and isolation of symptomatic cases alone reduced Reff by 0.2 to 0.3…”: I couldn’t read this from the top rows of Figure 1. This may correspond to 0% of cases sharing data or 0% trace success probability, but Reff for such a scenario cannot be read from the figure because there is no colour scales or numbers.  “When identification and isolation…substantial effects.”: I am not sure how “moderate levels” and “substantial effects” are defined.  “Due to the exponential growth of uncontrolled epidemics…over a given timespan”: As stated above, this is only the case if contact tracing can continue without hitting the capacity. If R goes back to the original level after tracing is overwhelmed, there may be only a marginal difference in the final epidemic size.  Discussion, “Higher rates of cooperation…quarantine and isolation”: related to the first major comment, these efforts would make tracing more effective but require a substantial amount of effort and cost, and warrant discussion.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  In this study the authors use established and previously published models of contact tracing to examine whether targeted test and trace systems could suppress novel variants. The premise is sound; contact tracing scales poorly, so while it is not necessarily effective at control SARS-CoV-2 at large once national prevalence is high, the numbers of certain variants are still low in a number of countries and therefore contact tracing might be able to control those new variants as they are seeded into a country. Whether this approach would work or not is not trivially obvious and so this study is asking an important question with policy implications globally. The analytical approach taken is quite simple in that the authors assume (and back up with some literature) that the variants can be identified easily and that therefore contact tracing of a new variant can continue without any reference to the dominant variant.  Comments: Most of my comments relate to this assumption that contact tracing of new variants can be modelled by simply ignoring the dominant variant.  First, I would like to see this assumption explicitly stated in the methods just to make it completely clear to the reader.  There are a number of further considerations with this assumption that I think should be discussed.  Given the high rate of vaccination and previous infection with the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, many countries are now in a state where immunity cannot be ignored. This is all handled by Reff, but I think it needs to be mentioned that Reff is combining NPIs, immunity or partial immunity from vaccination (depending on whether there's vaccine escape in the variant)  and partial immunity from previous infection with other strains.  The authors state that new variants can be detected with RT-PCR and TaqPath. However, does this extra step create no extra delay in the process? I imagine this would depend on the specific organisation but might be worth considering and mentioning.  Furthermore, is this identification of variants 100% accurate? The false negative rate (someone is infected with a new variant but the test says they are infected with the original variant) can be just included as part of the test sensitivity and I wouldn't be surprised if the difference is fairly small. More worrying for me is the false positive rate (someone is infected with the original variant but the tests says they are infected with a new variant). This is important because the rationale for the study relies entirely on the fact that there are not many cases with the new variant in a country but if, say, the false positive rate (as defined above) is even 1% then the large number of original variant cases in a country will quickly lead to the targeted test-trace-isolate system being swamped. This effect will obviously vary with the prevalence of original variant SARS-CoV-2.  I only know the literature for the UK, but even the lowest compliance rates used here are much higher than those measured (I wouldn't be surprised if some countries have much high compliance rates though). I am taking my values from the reference below (Smith et al., 20201),  but there might be more up-to-date surveys in the UK and I don't know at all about other countries.  From self-reported behaviour (past behaviour, not intentions) in the UK, about 12% of people with symptoms requested a test. This relates to the 50% of symptomatic cases identified without tracing parameter. Some details of how you selected 50% from ref 32 would be useful, as the values in that paper range from 5% to 100% depending on the country and time. In the UK, of those contacted by track and trace, 11% of people fully complied with 2 weeks self isolation (this relates to the 50%-90% comply with isolation parameter). So at the very least I think it might be useful to state that these values might be quite optimistic in some settings.  Finally, a minor and subjective point, but it might be useful to present Figure 1 with a diverging colour palette that clearly distinguishes Reff < 1 and Reff > 1.

As a result, findings of MRI studies are often presented in 2D instead. A solution is to create figures that include perspective and can convey 3D information; such figures can sometimes be produced by standard functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis packages and related specialty programs. However, many options cannot provide functionality such as visualizing activation clusters that are both cortical and subcortical (i.e., a 3D glass brain), the production of several statistical maps with an identical perspective in the 3D rendering, or animated renderings. Here I detail an approach for creating 3D visualizations of MRI data that satisfies all of these criteria. Though a 3D ‘glass brain’ rendering can sometimes be difficult to interpret, they are useful in showing a more overall representation of the results, whereas the traditional slices show a more local view. Combined, presenting both 2D and 3D representations of MR images can provide a more comprehensive view of the study’s findings.","Approved  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.

This is something that is sometimes done in current neuroimaging research, but that is rarely done in a standardized manner, which makes this guide timely and relevant. In many cases, researchers choose to use 2D images instead, which can sometimes distort or omit information, as fMRI depictions are derived from an inherently 3-dimensional signal. The current manuscript separately describes ways to visualize clusters of activation (i.e. activation as it would be found when running an fMRI experiment) and anatomical regions of interest. It also provides hyperlinks to download relevant visualization software. The author goes into sufficient detail to include, for example, information on price and OS compatibility of different software packages. Also, the text provides details about how to create the images within a particular software package, or functions that increase user efficiency. Information like this, in addition to several informative illustrations in the manuscript, will make this text particularly useful for many people working in neuroimaging, and I am convinced that the publication of this manuscript will lead to a fruitful online discussion about the best ways to visualize and report 3D brain data.The title, abstract, and structuring of the manuscript are well-written and appropriate for its purpose as a brief guide.Overall, this concise and informative guide is useful, interesting, and well-written. I recommend its indexing after some very minor comments (listed below) have been addressed to increase the readability of the manuscript. Minor suggestions:While the term ‘3D’ could be considered to be a household word, I would still recommend to spell it out as ‘three-dimensional (3D)’ or ‘3-dimensional (3D)’ the first time the term is used in the text. Likewise, the term ‘glass brain’ is intuitive, but not always used in the same way by all researchers. A quick description of the concept at the first mention of the term in the text would make the manuscript more accessible to the general reader.",400,0,0,0.8096,0.195990991,0.9470573664,2,29.18,0.1953,f1000,0.0105263157894737,3,4,3,3,partially factual,3,3,65,polite,3,positive,3,moderate,4,5,5,5,factual,5,5,95,polite,5,positive,5,none,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,factual,5.0,5.0,90.0,polite,5.0,positive,4.0,none,4,5,4,4,factual,5,4,85,polite,5,positive,4,low,3,4,4,5,factual,4,4,92,polite,5,positive,5,low

Here are some minor commentsYou do not mention anything about multiple comparisons for the thresholding. I understand that these visualizations are mainly for obtaining a better understanding of the brain activation, but it would still be nice to mention the problems of multiple testing. For cluster level inference, I prefer if a cluster p-value threshold is used, and not an arbitrary cluster size like 400 mm3 or 50 voxels. Cluster p-values can be obtained through parametric methods (Gaussian random field theory, available in SPM and FSL) or non-parametric methods (permutation testing, available in SnPM, FSL and BROCCOLI). I know that a very common approach is to use a cluster defining threshold of p = 0.001 or p = 0.005 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons), combined with an arbitrary cluster size threshold of 10 voxels. Such approaches should in my opinion be avoided, since the method is ad-hoc; it is impossible to know what the (corrected) p-value is for the combined procedure.The following paper may be of interest:Choong-Wan Woo, Anjali Krishnan, Tor D.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  This is a very useful guide to an important issue that is currently largely overlooked in the literature; producing high-quality presentations of brain imaging results that are informative, clear, and useful. The article is comprehensive and easy to follow, and the examples provided are appropriate, and produce very attractive images. This is an extremely useful paper that deserves wide readership in the field.While I agree with the author that ‘glass-brain’ visualisations are extremely useful for providing a comprehensive overview of patterns of brain activity in fMRI experiments, that doesn’t mean that conventional 2D slice views are not also useful. In fact, 2D views of particular activation clusters are really the only way to get a good idea of the precise position of a cluster, in relation to the sulcal/gyral anatomy, which is often important. An optimal strategy for comprehensive visualisation and localisation might then be to combine 2D and 3D views of results in the same figure. The author has done this more-or-less in Figure 3 (which includes coronal slices), but I wonder if perhaps an additional example figure which combines 2D and 3D views might be helpful? Perhaps as an example of the kinds of ‘real’ figures that could be produced for publications and presentations.Minor points of grammar, etc.:Abstract:""they are useful in showing a more overall representation of the results"" More overall?

Following a preliminary diagnosis, fine-needle aspirate cytology (FNAC) may be used to obtain cells for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis and histopathological examination. This study aimed to assess the FNAC method combined with embedding samples in paraffin blocks (cell blocks) and comparing this with core biopsies (tissue blocks). Methods: This observational, prospective study was performed at our hospital and involved 50 female participants who presented with breast masses and were subsequently evaluated for high-risk status by FNAC and IHC. Tests for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human EGF receptor 2 (HER2/neu) were performed and the sensitivity, specificity, and discrepancy rates between methodologies were calculated using correlation analysis and agreement tests. Results: The correlation analysis between immuno-staining of sections from cell blocks and histopathological examination of sections from tumor-tissue blocks revealed a high concordance for HR and HER2/neu. Conclusion: IHC of cell-block sections was found to be better for the determination of HR status and HER2/neu levels. It is very important to obtain high-quality cell blocks with strict quality control for their clarification.","Approved With Reservations  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.  Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  This work is a comparison of paraffin embedded FNABs versus tissue blocks for the assessment of HR, and HER2/neu expression. This is an important piece of work. However, the study lacks depth. I have the following comments and suggestions. The manuscript requires language correction. Some sections need to be re-written as they were not clear to me.  Routine immunohistochemical method for assessment of HR, and HER2/neu has been used for a long time now. It appeared to me that invasive nature of core biopsies is a problem and the authors seek to evaluate the performance of paraffin embedded FNAB. The authors could have given an account of similar work upfront in the introduction. That could be followed by what this study particularly has to offer to provide new or additional insights. The literature on others' work could have been discussed.  Sample size is small. Hence the authors should be cautious in making conclusions about the outcome of the study, with particular reference to the data in tables 2 and 3.  The scoring method for HR and HER2/neu expression should be clearly stated.  Discrepancy between Table 1 and data described in the first paragraph of the Discussion section. Figure 1 shows 78% ductal carcinoma, 16% lobular, 4% mixed and 2% mucinous. However, in the cell block data discussed in the first paragraph of the discussion mentions- 74% ductal, 16% lobular, 4% mixed and 6% mucinous.  Similar data for the tissue block results were 64% ductal, 16% lobular and 14% mixed. However, I don't see any raw data for the same.  The expression of HR and HER2/neu was concluded as false positive or false negative based on the assumption that the data from the tissue blocks provided the true picture. However, the tissue block method may itself have a small but a certain rate of false positives and false negatives. Although, I do understand that specificity and sensitivity are evaluated based on certain truth, which the tissue block data is assumed to represent.  The authors have mentioned that "" the patients with lobular breast cancer tended to be younger"". What is the statistical basis for that? The F value (0.356) and the p value (0.785) does not suggest that this is true.  I did not find the relevance or utility of the second and third paragraphs in the discussion part of the manuscript.  How is the discrepancy (Table 3) calculated?  The authors have determined the specificity and sensitivity of the cell block method in reference to the tissue block method. However, there is no clear picture as to how the levels of expression been scored. In table 2, what is the cut-off score for each marker (HRs and HER2/neu) for categorizing the samples as positive or negative.  Having used the Cohen's kappa for assessment of the agreement between the data from two methods, what is the need for Spearman's correlation coefficient? Having good correlation is one thing, but whether the methods are agreeing well with the levels of expression of a particular marker is another. In this context the protocol for scoring is important. These issues need to be scrutinized by an expert statistician.  Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature? Partly  Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound? Yes  Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others? No  If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate? I cannot comment. A qualified statistician is required.

133,Jérôme-Euzenat,Ontology Alignment Revisited: A Bibliometric Narrative,"Ontology alignment is an important problem in the Semantic Web with diverse applications in various disciplines. This paper delineates this vital field of study by analyzing a core set of research outputs from the domain. In this regard, the related publication records are extracted for the period of 2001 to 2018 by using a proper inquiry on the well-known database Scopus. The article details the evolution and progress of ontology alignment since its genesis by conducting two classes of analyses, namely, semantic and structural, on the retrieved publication records from Scopus. Semantic analysis entails the overall discovery of concepts, notions, and research lines flowing underneath ontology alignment, while the structural analysis provides a meta-level overview of the field by probing into the collaboration network and citation analysis in author and country levels. In addition to these analyses, the paper discusses the limitations and puts forward lines for the further progress of ontology alignment. ","The paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the field of Ontology matching. It applies a 'semantic analysis', trying to extract topics from papers, and a 'structural' analysis studying only the bibliographic characteristics of the literature (authorship, citation, etc.). Since, the Semantic web journal is not a journal about bibliometrics, this paper is rather particular for the journal. To be clear, it only uses classical techniques and does not apply semantic web technologies to bibliometrics. However, a part of the semantic web, Ontology matching, is the object of this study. That could be of interest to the journal readership, especially if remarkable features of the field were unveiled. The work seems to have been seriously done, as far as I can judge and most of what is expressed is clear. Unfortunately, after reading it, it does not seem worth publishing. The main problem is the lack of objective: what is this work trying to assess? For most of the presented study, there is no hypothesis tested and no interesting finding reported (except at one point, but without seriously seeking to explain it, see below). It is just like if the reported figures were totally indifferent and that the paper would have been the same with different figures. Another issue is the lack of baseline for the presented data. Indeed, it is impossible to know if the observed properties are specific to the Ontology matching field, or if they apply equally in other fields. At least, it would have been good to have a comparison with the broader context, i.e. comparing with Semantic web and Computer science. It is possible to observe features of the Ontology matching field, but no way for the reader to understand if these are remarkable or not. Finally, in these times of Open science, it is regrettable that no mention is made of the availability of the data.  These points are the major issues. I discuss below various problems, some of them related to the issues above, some of them discussing particular points. They may help the authors to improve their paper.  * Organisation: - The introduction does not state any goal for the paper, neither claim any findings. It rather describes the applied treatments. - Section 2 provides a methodology. However, in absence of statement about the goal of the analysis, it is not possible to judge the relevance of the methodology. - Section 2.1 details lenghtly the preprocessing of WoS, before turning more succintly to Scopus which was actually used. This seems a strange way to present things. * Data interpretation: - The topic analysis is not particularly insightful. In particular, it does not provide much information on ontology matching but on its use. It seems to gather the terms in an unprincipled way (heterogeneous and automatic appear in most of them, biomedical is in the learn cloud while anatomy is in the query one, etc.). It may have been interesting to see all the generated 'topics' that the authors did not retain. In the end it is unclear, which conclusions may be drawn from the topic analysis. - p10: 'Ontology alignment outputs form 6.1% of the top 10% most cited article worldwide in year 2013' (I simplified). How can this be? From Fig. 3, there seems to be no more than 300 papers in scopus on 'ontology alignment' for 2013. If they are all in the 10% most cited papers and these are 6.1% of them, this means that there was only 10*300/6.1%~50000 papers indexed by Scopus (if not all 300 are in the most cited, then this is even less). This does not seem to be right: I counted 2.8Mdocuments in Scopus for 2013. It seems to me that what was meant is that 6.1% of the 'ontology alignment' papers are in the 10% most cited papers. Again with no comparison to the same figure for Semantic web or Computer science, it is difficult to tell that this figure is specific to Ontology alignment (there are fields with more citations and fields with less citations, e.g. Mathematics, and putting them all together means that some are above average and some other are below). - Section 4.3 is about disciplines relevant to Ontology matching. Given the broad categories used here (the level 2 categories of Fig 7), is it unclear that this characterisation is useful for something. - Section 5.1-5.2 about collaboration are those that could be thought of as providing some findings. Figure 8 is stunning at providing two identified clusters. The authors do not provide much explanation about this phenomenon, they suggest that may be the researchers from one cluster are not curious about the others. However, these graphs being computed on collaboration, a symmetric measure, it seems that this explanation should, at the very least, be applied symmetrically. It is difficult from this data alone to provide an explanation, but many could be put forth. In particular, the fact that one of this cluster is mononational and the other international suggest that the explanation comes from some national elements (but see discussion below). These may be linguistic factors, the collaboration approach, work approach (many coauthors, many authors of only one paper, e.g. undergraduate students: this can be studied bibliometrically), publication policies (strong incentive to publish many papers and in scopus indexed journal, hence less in the Ontology matching workshop). It is possible that many of these factors play some role together... Finally, again in the absence of comparison with other fields, it is difficult to assess if this is due to the Ontology matching field. - This judgement made on collaborations is also made on citations (though to a far lesser extent). That could have helped sheding light on this matter because citation is not symmetric. Unfortunately, in 6.2, citations are only reported as numbers assigned to papers and country so, they are not helpful. This is too bad because if a community has less citation per paper than another, it is difficult to explain it by discrimination if both communities have the same citation pattern (they both cite less the same community). At least, it would have been worth to rule out this possibility. - As I understand from the text, six communities were extracted and only two are shown in Figure 9. If the number 6 was not given to the algorithm and is significant, then the six should be shown. - 5.1 Author collaboration: the conclusion drawn on page 14 are very general and not specific to Ontology matching. - p16 ""the research outputs with at least one Chinese author have not gained enough attention"": it is unclear on what ground this statement is based. Same thing for ""they do not get enough attention, possibly the attention they deserve"". - Again, 5.3-5.4 would deserve to be compared with the broader Semantic web/Computer science fields. - The authors ""encourage the organisers of OAEI"" to have benchmarks on the identified topics. Unfortunately, these topics are not application domains, like biomedicine, but application techniques, like ""Semantic Web Services, agent-based modelling, knowledge-graphs, and business processes (cited directly from the paper)"". This means that there are not many ontologies to match there... and some of them have been considered, e.g. Process matching. * Data presentation: - Figure 2 displays data as tag clouds. The precise interpretation of tag clouds is quite unclear to me, so if there is one, it should be provided. In general, it does not seems like tag clouds are a proper scientific visualisation instrument (no unit, no scale, esthetic arrangement). - Figure 8 is interesting, but it would also be interesting to understand the space, i.e. what are the principles of entity placement. The same applies to Figure 17. - The assignment of authors to countries is not specified. One of the most collaborative ""Chinese scientist"" is ""S. Wang"". I assume that this is Shenghui Wang. Shenghui published her work while at VU Amsterdam. It is unclear that she should count as Chinese (in such a case, Pavel Shvaiko is from Belarus, Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz from Spain, Cassia Trojahn from Brazil, etc.). In this sense, she is atypical (less and less atypical as time passes), and seems to indicate that the two clusters are rather based on the involvement in an international collaboration network or not, rather than nationality. This, in turn, may have other causes (see above). - Figure 9 is unreadable in black and white. * Form: - The title of the paper is quite strange: ontology alignment is not really revisited and there is not real ""narrative"" provided here. Moreover, this is not really the purpose of scientific journals to publish ""narratives"", but findings. - The introduction uses a flourished language that is also a bit remote from fact. For instance: ""the heterogenity problem was quite epidemic"" is not particularly clear. * Details: - p4: '""ontology alignment"", which is interchangeably referred to as ""ontology matching"" or ""ontology mapping""': it is not clear by whom. - It may have been interesting to look for outliers in this data set. In particular, books and review papers traditionally get a lot of citation: do these figures look the same if they are retracted from the corpus? I do not know if it is accepted practice in bibliometrics and this is less important than comparing with external fields. - p22 there seem to be a missing reference. - In some instances, such as reference 2 or Table 2, problems with characters.",1570,0,3,0.7853,0.0533716842,0.9450801611,84,55.13,0.0743,semanticweb,0.0,4,4,5,3,factual,4,3,80,neutral,4,positive,4,low,4,4,4,4,factual,4,4,75,polite,5,negative,5,moderate,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,partially factual,3.0,2.0,60.0,polite,4.0,neutral,4.0,moderate,3,4,5,3,factual,4,4,75,neutral,5,negative,4,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,4,75,neutral,5,negative,3,low
191,Reviewer-1FB4,Video Prediction Models as Rewards for Reinforcement Learning,"Specifying reward signals that allow agents to learn complex behaviors is a long-standing challenge in reinforcement learning.
A promising approach is to extract preferences for behaviors from unlabeled videos, which are widely available on the internet. We present Video Prediction Rewards (VIPER), an algorithm that leverages pretrained video prediction models as action-free reward signals for reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first train an autoregressive transformer on expert videos and then use the video prediction likelihoods as reward signals for a reinforcement learning agent. VIPER enables expert-level control without programmatic task rewards across a wide range of DMC, Atari, and RLBench tasks. Moreover, generalization of the video prediction model allows us to derive rewards for an out-of-distribution environment where no expert data is available, enabling cross-embodiment generalization for tabletop manipulation. We see our work as starting point for scalable reward specification from unlabeled videos that will benefit from the rapid advances in generative modeling. Source code and datasets are available on the project website: https://ViperRL.com","This paper proposes Video Prediction Rewards (VIPER), a general architecture that extracts reward functions from action-free expert demonstrations. To match the agent's trajectory distribution with the source distribution, VIPER optimizes the agent to maximize a log-likelihood estimated by an auto-regressive video model and an entropy term to encourage exploration.

Experiments on DMC, Atari, and RLBench demonstrate the soundness and efficiency of the reward function extracted by VIPER. VIPER addresses the practical challenge of how to extract reward functions from action-free expert demonstrations in order to optimize our agents, which is useful in settings like self-driving.
VIPER has the following strengths:
- VIPER can extract effective reward functions and thus promote policy optimization in a range of visual control tasks.
- Experiments show that reward functions learned by VIPER can generalize to a variety of tasks and even OOD tasks. Although VIPER shows good experiments results, some weaknesses still exist:

- The data efficiency of VIPER seems to be low as it requires nearly 10M data to converge in DMC. Also, it seems that VIPER can not leverage sub-optimal demonstrations, which could be important for improving data efficiency.
- It could be difficult and expensive to acquire a generative video model for real-world tasks, especially with visual distractors. 
- Also, I think current tasks are a little bit less challenging, and thus it might be easier to define a reward function than acquire expert demonstrations. Therefore, it could be interesting if we could test VIPER's performance with tasks that are hard to define rewards, e.g. embodied tasks like \[Habitat\](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim) or self-driving platforms. - To my understanding, VIPER's setting is similar to Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), while GAIL uses the critic as the surrogate of the distance between the expert trajectory distribution and generated trajectory distribution, VIPER directly estimates the distance (KL divergence) by modeling the log-likelihood with a generative model. I have some reservations regarding the benefits of doing so.

VIPER enables expert-level control without programmatic task rewards across a wide range of DMC, Atari, and RLBench tasks. Moreover, generalization of the video prediction model allows us to derive rewards for an out-of-distribution environment where no expert data is available, enabling cross-embodiment generalization for tabletop manipulation. We see our work as starting point for scalable reward specification from unlabeled videos that will benefit from the rapid advances in generative modeling. Source code and datasets are available on the project website: https://ViperRL.com","This paper proposes a learning-from-observation algorithm that builds a reward based on a video predictor trained from action-free expert videos. Experimental results show that online reinforcement learning algorithms can learn a working policy from their reward only effectively. This paper contains rich and informative ablation studies and analyses to verify their design choices. 1.	The paper writing is clear and easy to understand
2.	Distilling knowledge from action-free videos to policies is a promising future direction for robotics.
3.	Experiments are rich. The authors test their method with two different online RL methods, two different exploration losses, three task domains, and three different video prediction models. The experiments on the generalization ability (Sec. 4.3) are not convincing enough. The video prediction model in Sec.4.3 is trained with 23 Rethink-robot-arm tasks and 30 Franka-robot-arm tasks. There should be dozens of OOD arm/task combinations that can be evaluated. However, according to L300, we only see the performance on only ONE OOD combination. How is the performance on other OOD combinations? Besides, the learning curve in Fig.8 doesn’t include a task oracle like other experiments in the paper. So we also don’t know how good the OOD performance is. Therefore, I think the third contribution of this paper, “VIPER generalizes to different environments”, is not well-supported. 1.	How good is the generalization ability of VIPER? We definitely need evaluations on more OOD combinations to support the statement in the third contribution. 
2.	For Fig.8, which OOD combination the curve shows? In addition, this curve doesn’t include an error bar like other experiments in the paper.

Source code and datasets are available on the project website: https://ViperRL.com","This paper proposes to use prediction likelihoods from autoregressive video models as reward functions to train reinforcement learning agents. Specifically, the conditional likelihood $\log p(x_{t+1}|x_{1:t})$ is augmented with an exploration reward to avoid suboptimal behavior. The authors conduct extensive experiments and show that likelihoods of autoregressive video models can be effective for reward specification. They also show that in certain cases the video models can generalize to unseen task domains, encouraging satisfying behaviors. Their ablation study compares different video models, different exploration objectives, and different context lengths.  Originality: Though the idea of using likelihood of states/observations as a reward is not novel, taking the temporal coherence into consideration with an autoregressive factorization is novel at my end. 

Quality: This work is strong in its efforts in extensive experiments. 

Clarity: This paper is straightforward to follow. The narrative is very intuitive. Experimental details are very well documented. 

Significance: Learning memory-based reward function with sequence modeling is an interesting direction to explore given the current advances of generative models.  In spite of the impressive amount of experiments presented in this work, one fundamental problem unresolved in this work is why the autoregressive likelihood, which is inherently non-Markov, can work with general RL algorithms, in which TD learning strongly depends on Markovian rewards. Latent-space model-based RL methods such as Dreamer used in this work are too particular because the latent-space modeling may resolve the limitation of TD learning as a byproduct. This means the empirical result from this work cannot be trivially generalized to other RL methods, rendering the thesis statement an overclaim.  Apart from the question I raised in Weakness, I hope the authors would also like to resolve my concerns in Section 4.3. 

While the paper claimed that specifying reward functions with video models can generalize to OOD tasks, Section 4.3 only demonstrate a particular case where there is a recombination of robot and objects to be manipulated. Is it possible to make the evaluation of generalization more systematic? I guess readers may be more interested in a discussion of what ""types"" of generalization are possible to eliminate the influence of particularity.  As stated in Weakness, there is a technical limitation of the proposed method that the authors do not seem to notice. Other limitations are well documented in Section 5.

The design includes using VQ-GAN to encode discrete embeddings and incorporating an exploration bonus (opt for Plan2Explore and RND). In experiments, the authors also show the learned rewards provide a useful learning signal for online RL.  1. The paper is well-written and the idea is clear.
2. The authors make comparisons on multiple tasks.  1. The effectiveness of the proposed method may be limited if the expert data is scarce. 
2. In many imitation learning papers almost only one expert trajectory is needed, however, this paper undoubtedly requires a lot of expert data (to train the video prediction model).
3. Although the authors make comparisons on multiple tasks, there are few baselines. There are many papers on imitation learning that do not make experimental comparisons, e.g. \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\].

\[2\] Demodice: Offline imitation learning with supplementary imperfect demonstrations
\[3\] Behavioral cloning from observation
\[4\] Generative adversarial imitation from observation 
\[5\] CLUE: Calibrated Latent Guidance for Offline Reinforcement Learning 1. Can the author compare the proposed method to more imitation learning papers?
2. Doesn't the method suffer from the problem of OOD issues when there is very little expert data? Even when a dozen or so pieces of expert data exist, it seems that the OOD problem exists, i.e., the pre-trained video prediction model may falsely overestimate the probability of some behaviors that are not expert behaviors.
3. After I thought deeply about it, I always thought that there is an OOD problem with the method, which is consistent with standard offline RL, as the policy network will make an effort to explore and discover behaviors with a high probability/likelihood, however, these behaviors may be falsely overestimated by the video prediction network. 
4. In the main paper, I did not see the results that ""VIPER can achieve expert-level control without task rewards on 15 DMC tasks, 6 RLBench tasks, and 7 Atari tasks"". 
5. In addition, the authors only emphasize achieving expert-level performance and do not compare it to a large number of imitation learning baselines. This tends to raise doubts about the performance of the method, since with enough expert data, simple behavioral cloning can also achieve expert-level performance.

It talks about finding the ability of NLR as a prognostic indicator in organophosphorus poisoning. NLR as a prognostic indicator has been studied extensively in recent times in various other clinical conditions including cancer. Hence, the ROL should look into this including the methodology followed to find its prostic value, which will add further knowledge to the existing body of knowledge. The outcome variables of the study should be well defined before conducting the research. This will help in the designing the study and calculation of an appropriate sample size. The sample size should be calculated using AUC in ROC analysis from published literature. The outcome measures defined by the study's objectives will determine the role of appropriate statistical methods. The authors have not been able to spell out the outcome measures properly. Hence, the specificity of the use of statistical methods seems vague. This can lead to confusion at a later stage after data collection. Dummy tables and dummy analysis before the execution of the study will be useful. The Review of Literature (ROL) lacks a finding of NLR as an inflammatory marker. There is literature available on NLR as a prognostic marker in cancer. The authors have proposed data collection at a single time point, which will have a bias in the analysis as factors like time-to-intervention, dose-response, quality of care, etc., can not be accounted for in the analysis.  Finally, the sample size calculation is inappropriate as the study is NOT trying to find the prevalence of death among organophosphorus poisoning cases with NLR >12, rather with appropriate ROL, sample size calculation method has to be revisited.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  Dear Editor I have gone through the manuscript (study protocol) titled “A cross-sectional study of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio as a prognostic marker in acute organophosphorus poisoning in a tertiary care hospital in Central India”. Following are my comments for consideration (Major Revision) Several studies are already available which showed the role of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a prognostic marker in acute organophosphorus poisoning with detailed method/protocol (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0736467914005034 file:///C:/Users/Dr%20Deepak%20Kumar/Downloads/5-OA-Basanta+Gauli.pdf, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8284330/ ). Please elaborate.  Under study status it is mentioned as “The study has yet to start after the publication of the protocol; we will start recruitment in the study.”  However, under study design it is mentioned as  “Data will be collected at a single time point setup for the 2023-2024 period.” Considering the fact that it is mid-August 2024, when will the authors start the work and complete it within 2023-2024 period. So kindly revise the relevant content in the manuscript and its ethical approval accordingly.  Include the statement that the work will be carried out following the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration.  How the diagnosis of organophosphorus pesticide exposure will be carried out? Or in other words which method was used to find out the confirmed cases of  OP poisoning? How the authors confirm the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Which parameter will be considered for this?  Estimation of AChE activity is of the method for understanding OP poisoning. However, both organophosphorus (OP) and organocarbamates (OC) inhibit AChE activity (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37805177/ ). Then how do the authors distinguish OP cases from OC. Please address this issue. This should be properly mentioned in the protocol. Under objectives, it is mentioned as under “To investigate whether the Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio is correlated with the dose of atropine administered to patients with acute organophosphorus poisoning.” In cases where organophosphate poisoning is on the differential but not confirmed, a trial of atropine is generally administered (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470430/#:~:text=If%20organophosphate%20poisoning%20is%20on,suspicion%20of%20AChE%20inhibitor%20poisoning. ). Then how do the investigators access the control NLR value (i.e., value before administration of atropine). Please discuss.  Mention which clinical/biochemical parameters will be considered for assessment.  Kindly include the following in the exclusion criteria: The patients who are on steroids, pregnant patients, and patients with blood disorders (https://www.jcmc.com.np/jcmc/index.php/jcmc/article/download/1311/836 ).

We illustrate the improved performance of our approach using multiple examples","The authors introduce a new training procedure for PINNs which are adapted to unknown measurement noise, i.e., a training procedure which works for any noise model. This is done via EBMs, which are trained jointly with the PINN. Here the EBMs estimate a 1d noise model based on the estimation of the PINN (conditional to the point $t_i$). Since they only estimate a 1d distribution, the (usually intractable) normalization constant can be estimated via numerical integration. The approach is tested on several (partial) differential equations and benchmarked against the standard PINN. The paper is easy to follow (except a few minor points). The idea is interesting and well-executed. The approach outperforms the standard PINN and offset PINN baseline. The experiments are well described, so that I think reproduction should be easy. 1) While the idea is heuristically clear, it would be interesting whether one can obtain theoretical guarantees. I have got the hunch that it should be possible to cast the framework into one of expectation maximization (EM) algorithms (maybe one slightly needs to change the loss and train alternating instead of jointly). Did the authors give this some thought? This would greatly strengthen the paper in my opinion. For this see e.g. \[1\]

2) The discussion in 4.1 and 4.2 is a bit confusing. While I think I got the gist of it, please make clear what variables the functions $\mu_{\varepsilon}$ and $\theta_0$ depend on. 

3) The metric logL is not clearly defined. How is that calculated in the case of a standard PINN, just Gaussian likelihood?

4) The non-Gaussian noise is a GMM. I would like to see physically more realistic noise models. One thing that could be interesting is whether this approach is able to learn mixed Gaussian noise, i.e., $y = f(t) + \eta_1 + f(t)\ \eta_2$ for normal $\eta_1,\eta_2$ with some variances. While this is still Gaussian, this is a noise model used in practice. 

5) Please make the relation to model errors \[2\] and \[3\] more clear. Although the model error framework tries to solve a different problem (Bayesian inversion) the ideas are somewhat similar.

6) A very similar is to train a surrogate on the data only (no PINN loss), then estimate the noise via an appropriate model, such as an EBM and then to train the surrogate on a combined loss. Please comment on this.

A joint loss function is used to train the EBM and the PINN, whereas the EBM can be trained at the same time or with a delayed start with respect to the PINN. Numerical experiments use synthetic data governed by several well-known PDEs from physics, polluted with a variety of noise distributions, to test the performance of the proposed approach. The approach is principled, the description is clear, the results are convincing. The proposed approach integrates two well-known models from the literature; the approach is straightforward and the results are not surprising. EBMs have been used before in classification, generative modeling, and regression problems; the authors state that the novelty is in the leveraging of physical knowledge within PINNs. In addition, all the results are focused on synthetic data. Thus the impact of the proposed approach appears limited to the current combination of tools for the usual applications of PINNs.

Minor comments:

In Algorithm 1, within the training loop, i should be updated. To better evaluate the impact of the proposed approach, it would be good to discuss the following questions:

(1) How is the formulation of the proposed approach different from the integration of EBM to a regular neural network?

(2) Is there real-world data that would usually be modeled by a PINN where non-Gaussian additive noise is present and for which the proposed approach can be shown to provide better solutions than the baseline PINN?",271,0,0,0.7132000000000001,0.0896616541,0.921692729,51,43.8468,0.1262,iclr,0.0104166666666666,4,4,4,4,factual,4,4,80,polite,4,neutral,4,low,4,5,4,4,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,factual,4.0,4.0,70.0,polite,4.0,neutral,3.0,none,3,5,4,3,factual,4,4,80,polite,5,neutral,5,low,3,4,3,4,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,4,low

To do this, the authors propose using the LM itself (or a teacher) to generate natural continuations for the ""updated/new entity"" definition. These continuations are used to update the LM. The update is conducted using a KL divergence loss between the LM conditioned on the definition and the LM that doesn't see the definition. The results show superiority to baselines in updates and in preserving old knowledge. The paper seems like an excellent contribution. It's well motivated, well presented, and the key idea is simple, novel, and effective. The evaluation is convincing. The method, like many others, is relatively opaque in terms of what it teaches the models and why/how it works precisely. However, it's well motivated and the analysis in Sec 7 begins to shed a little bit of light into this. More work is needed on that front, but I think it's fair to assume this will lie beyond the scope of this paper.

The framework involves two steps: 1) create a transfer set that contains the knowledge that the student model will be learning from; 2) compute the distribution of the transfer set tokens for both the teacher model (while given context, i.e. a definitional sentence) and the student model and update the student model's parameters by minimizing the KL divergence of the two distributions. The paper evaluates the student model with two sets, Entity Inferences and ECBD to show that the knowledge has successfully propagated. This paper is more efficient with multi-entity editing and achieves competitive performance on the two evaluation set in terms of propagation success (accuracy and decrease in perplexity) while causing little impact on specificity. It seems like the paper is more focusing on new knowledge ingestion, either in Entity Inference (synthetic entities) or ECBD (introducing new entities after 2022). While this is an important aspect, a harder task is to update existing knowledge in the old model. One dimension could be temporal shifts, e.g. after a new election, population/economic changes (potentially resulting changes in superlative statements), factual changing official announcement (e.g. solar system has 9 planets before 2006 and Pluto was downgraded to dwarf planet in 2006 - solar system has 8 planets now). It is unclear whether the model can adapt to the new facts while maintain low specificity.

Another baseline is to try prompting the LLMs with new knowledge and see how it propagates. If the existing LLMs can handle such knowledge updates well, it may be hard to justify why we need to train a separate student model. On line 126, it states the distillation is done through updating $M_s$ parameters to minimize the KL divergence. Does it update all the parameters in $M_s$, or is it possible to combine the distillation with other network editing techniques to only a local set of parameters? How much would it negatively impact the performance if only a local edit is allowed? Asking since if we want to extend this framework to larger LLMs (as current good-quality LLMs usually have 100B+ parameters and updating all parameters seem to be impossible). As mentioned by the authors, this work mainly uses relatively small size LMs for experiments and its generalizability to LLMs is unknown. While it may apply to LLM trainers/creators to adapt this method to update their models, it does not extend to end users/organizations of the LLMs who want to ingest or update knowledge, e.g. from specific domains or confidential sources, potentially through local edits.",457,0,0,0.7902,0.0358824734,0.9262851477,215,37.6838,0.0987,neurips,0.0,3,4,3,3,factual,4,3,65,neutral,4,neutral,3,low,4,4,4,5,partially factual,5,5,85,polite,5,neutral,5,moderate,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,factual,4.0,4.0,80.0,polite,5.0,neutral,3.0,none,3,4,4,4,factual,4,4,80,polite,5,neutral,5,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,4,low

4. The authors' method provides a scalable and effective way to update the knowledge of LMs.
 1. As the authors concede in Section'Limitations', their proposed methodology has yet to be substantiated on models of a larger scale. For instance, LLaMA-65B may present a fitting candidate for such validation.

124,Xihao-Li,Negligible effects of read trimming on the accuracy of germline short variant calling in the human genome,"Background Next generation sequencing (NGS) has become a standard tool in the molecular diagnostics of Mendelian disease, and the precision of such diagnostics is greatly affected by the accuracy of variant calling from sequencing data. Recently, we have comprehensively evaluated the performance of multiple variant calling pipelines. However, no systematic analysis of the effects of read trimming on variant discovery with modern variant calling software has yet been performed.  Methods In this work, we systematically evaluated the effects of adapters on the performance of 8 variant calling and filtering methods using 14 standard reference Genome-in-a-Bottle (GIAB) samples. Variant calls were compared to the ground truth variant sets, and the effect of adapter trimming with different tools was assessed using major performance metrics (precision, recall, and F1 score).  Results We show that adapter trimming has no effect on the accuracy of the best-performing variant callers (e.g., DeepVariant) on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. For whole-exome sequencing (WES) datasets subtle improvement of accuracy was observed in some of the samples. In high-coverage WES data (~200x mean coverage), adapter removal allowed for discovery of 2-4 additional true positive variants in only two out of seven datasets tested. Moreover, this effect was not dependent on the median insert size and proportion of adapter sequences in reads. Surprisingly, the effect of trimming on variant calling was reversed when moderate coverage (~80-100x) WES data was used. Finally, we show that some of the recently developed machine learning-based variant callers demonstrate greater dependence on the presence of adapters in reads.  Conclusions Taken together, our results indicate that adapter removal is unnecessary when calling germline variants, but suggest that preprocessing methods should be carefully chosen when developing and using machine learning-based variant analysis methods.","Approved With Reservations  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.  Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  This study provides a systematic evaluation of the effect of adapter trimming on the accuracy of germline short variant calling in the human genome, utilizing both whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) datasets. The comparison of multiple variant calling tools, with and without adapter trimming, reveals minimal impact on WGS data but suggests modest improvements in certain WES samples, particularly in indel detection. The study concludes that while adapter trimming may not be essential for WGS, it shows some benefits for specific WES cases. The manuscript is well-written and clear, making it accessible for readers. Below are a few comments for the authors to consider: The authors mention that “adapter trimming had very limited effects on both precision and recall.” It would be helpful to clarify and quantify the threshold for ""limited."" Providing a statistical measure, such as a p-value or confidence interval, would strengthen the interpretation of the findings. Additional explanation is needed for the samples that showed positive effects in Figure 1. Clarifying why these samples differ from the others would help contextualize the observed improvements. The authors are encouraged to elaborate on the reasons why results differ between SNP and indel calling. Further discussion on potential underlying mechanisms would enhance understanding. The statement that “trimming may even decrease the accuracy of analysis” warrants further discussion. Exploring potential reasons behind this observation could provide valuable insights into the circumstances in which trimming could be detrimental.

118,Pavel-Klinov,Module Extraction for Efficient Object Query over Ontologies with Large ABoxes,"The extraction of logically-independent fragments out of an ontology ABox can be useful\nfor solving the tractability problem of querying ontologies with large ABoxes. In this\npaper, we propose a formal definition of an ABox module, such that it guarantees complete\npreservation of facts about a given set of individuals, and thus can be reasoned\nindependently w.r.t. the ontology TBox. With ABox modules of this type, isolated or\ndistributed (parallel) ABox reasoning becomes feasible, and more efficient data retrieval\nfrom ontology ABoxes can be attained. To compute such an ABox module, we present a\ntheoretical approach and also an approximation for SHIQ ontologies. Evaluation of the\nmodule approximation on different types of ontologies shows that, on average, extracted\nABox modules are significantly smaller than the entire ABox, and the time for ontology\nreasoning based on ABox modules can be improved significantly.","In this paper the authors define the notion of ABox modules, i.e. fragments of the ABox which capture entailments for the given individual w.r.t. the concept names and roles occurring in the ontology. In addition to the generic definition, the authors propose a specialization, called Exact Abox module, and proceed to investigating how (approximations of) such modules can be computed efficiently for SHIQ ontologies. The paper ends with a fairly extensive evaluation on several hand-picked ontologies showing that most of ABox modules are small and thus reasoning over them is much faster than over the entire ABox. ===Significance and novelty=== I believe the paper addresses an important topic since the existing notions of logic-based modules are defined w.r.t. a fixed signature whereas it is often important to capture a certain class of entailments over the signature which is not known in advance (e.g., all class and property assertions for an individual). However, it must be noted that the proposed modules would only preserve atomic entailments, e.g., atomic concept assertions, and do not guarantee that answering complex queries, e.g., DL queries for arbitrary concept expressions, over the module will return the same results. It is also not clear how (or if) the proposed modularization will help evaluating conjunctive queries which may return individuals from multiple modules. Remark 3.2 says (correctly) that answering DL queries can be reduced to instance retrieval for a fresh concept name but this would probably require to recompute existing modules (since the TBox has changed). This is obviously undesirable. I believe the paper adequately discusses related work.  ===Contributions and technical quality=== I'll comment separately on each individual contribution. The notion of ABox module. This notion simply provides conditions which a fragment of the ABox must meet in order to be called ""ABox module"". The authors correctly note that it does not prevent the module from containing superfluous parts. The notion of exact ABox module. This is where things get interesting, this notion basically says that the ABox module is a union over all justifications of atomic ABox facts about the individual. On the one hand, this makes sense because it trivially implies that any exact module is a module. On the other hand, this definition shouldn't be directly used for extracting modules because just one justification per assertion would be enough. BTW, the proposed definition guarantees the property which is called ""depletedness"" for locality-based modules: the ontology minus the module entails nothing about the individual. It'd be good to mention it.   It is unfortunate that the authors decided to jump directly to the extraction aspects and did not spend any time discussing the properties of their modules, e.g. whether there're counterparts of such properties of locality-based modules as robustness under signature restrictions, self-containedness, etc. (see [1] and [2]). It'd be good to fully understand what the modules are before starting to extract them.  Extracting exact ABox modules. This is the most problematic section of the paper, which suffers from imprecise notions, statements, and lack of proofs. Here are the main issues: 1) Page 11: the whole notion of ""class term behind a's assertions..."" is totally undefined and very confusing. It's rather unfortunate because the authors seem to build the extraction methodology on it (which culminates with the condition (3) which is then referenced in many other places). Both this notion and the condition (3) must be made proper (formal) definitions. Then the statement that the condition (3) is necessary and sufficient for entailing a concept assertion should be formulated as a proposition. 2) Page 12: Nothing is proved (or even formulated) about the extraction procedure shown at the top of the page. This is actually one of the central contributions of the paper: the algorithm for extracting exact ABox modules. It has to be shown that 1) it is correct, i.e. it selects all and only module-essential assertions, 2) it terminates (this is rather easy), and 3) what it's complexity is (apparently as hard as reasoning for Exptime-logics).  Extracting approximate ABox modules. The authors propose a syntactic check to decide if an axiom can be potentially relevant for individual entailments. Unfortunately it's rather hard to understand until (3) is made clear (because the syntactic form essentially approximates (3)).  Evaluation. The performed evaluation is pretty strong and shows several important results, e.g., i) approximate ABox module extraction is fast (Table 1) and ii) approximate ABox modules are generally small (Table 2). But some issues need to be fixed: 1) It's not described how the TBox of DBPedia ontologies was generated (page 19). Apparently some complex class expression have been auto-generated but the methodology isn't explained. 2) According to which principles were these ontologies selected? What makes them representative or interesting (other than large ABoxes which are sometimes synthetic)? There some others ontologies with large ABoxes, e.g., the IMDB ontology. 3) I wonder if any of the ontologies contain transitive roles (and assertions for them). My understanding is that transitive roles could be one of the main difficulties because they can blow the property module for ""a"" (by including role assertions for other individuals). If not, this is a weakness. 4) It's unclear how the time spent on module extraction for a single individual was measured, e.g., were all extractions done independently or was the whole ABox modularized in one go? ===Presentation=== While most of the prose is OK, the paper suffers from various imprecise statements and confusing/incoherent use of terminology. Here are some of the issues: * p2: ""... up to exponential worst-case complexity..."", actually it's N2ExpTime for SROIQ. * p2: "".. a setting of semantic webs"" -> ""the Semantic Web setting"". * p2: One has to be precise when talking about the closure of logical implications (e.g., does it include concept assertions for complex concepts of arbitrary length?). * Definition 2.3 isn't quite a definition. T and A have to be defined precisely as sets of axioms of a specific form. * Definition 2.5: ""Logic Entailment"" -> ""Logical Entailment""? * p6, top: The statement that all reasoners implement (hyper)-tableau isn't quite true. Even for expressive DLs, e.g. Horn-SHIQ, there're other methods such as consequence-based reasoning. * Definition 2.9: ""to be"" is missing * Definition 3.4: need to make clear that Just(alpha, K) here means *some* justification, not any specific justification of alpha. * p8 and elsewhere: It'd be considerably better to define equality-free ontologies syntactically. I.e., if I have an ontology, how do I know which extraction procedure should I run, the one which accounts for individual equality or the simpler one? * p11: what is meant by ""decidable R-neighbors""? The same goes for "" its subsumer is undecidable."" on page 13. * Proposition 4.3: it'd be better if this fact was proved without explicitly referring to the tableau's completion rules. It's a fact about the logic, not any particular calculus. * p14: Essentially the same comment applies to the Module Extraction with Equality section. Explicitly referring to particular tableau rules brings nothing but trouble. Also the statement that equality requires reasoning to detect it is strange since reasoning is required anyway to compute exact ABox modules. * Proposition 5.1: are we talking about asserted or inferred R-successors? Again, what it ""equality-free ABox"" exactly? * Definition 5.1 seems to define potential equivalents in terms of potential equivalents. Until it's fixed I find it nearly impossible to understand Proposition 5.2, which is the key statement about module extraction from ABoxes with equality. Perhaps it would help to prove the simpler Proposition 5.1 first. * Table 1 and 2: better to explain columns in the captions rather than in text on some other page. * p19, end: what is ""entities"" here? Definition 2.7 says that signature is always a set of individuals. Can entities refer to something else? * p22: It seems that this optimization will lead to the modules not being exact ABox modules any more (since not all module-essential axioms will be included). Better to say it explicitly. ===Summary=== In general, this is a potentially useful paper which presents module notions and extraction methods which can prove useful for applications dealing with instance checking w.r.t. large ABoxes. Eventually I'd like it to be published but I believe it needs another round of reviewing after some key notions and conditions (condition (3), most prominently) are made precise. Also, it can't be published until the correctness of the main extraction procedure (for exact modules) has been formally proved and reviewed (since all subsequent results, e.g. approximations, are based on it).

177,Maarten-Franciscus-Schim-van-der-Loeff,The development of mouthwashes without anti-gonococcal activity for controlled clinical trials: an in vitro study,"Background: The oropharynx plays a major role in the development and spread of antimicrobial resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae among men who have sex with men. Trials are currently assessing the efficacy of bactericidal mouthwashes as possible therapeutic or preventive options against these pharyngeal gonococcal infections. Controlled clinical trials require the use of a placebo mouthwash without anti-gonococcal activity. So far, no such mouthwash has been described. We describe the development of a mouthwash for this purpose. Methods: The in vitro anti-gonococcal activity of Corsodyl®, Listerine Cool Mint®, Biotene®, phosphate buffered saline and six in-house placebo mouthwashes was evaluated. Three gonococcal isolates from patients with pharyngeal infection were exposed to the mouthwashes for a duration ranging from 30 seconds to 60 minutes. Isolates were then plated onto blood agar (5% horse blood) and incubated for 24 hours (5-7% CO2, 35 ± 2°C). Growth of N. gonorrhoeae was scored on a five-point scale (0 to 4). All experiments were conducted in duplicate. Results: Corsodyl® and Listerine Cool Mint® were bactericidal to all isolates. For the other mouthwashes, the median growth score after 60 minutes of exposure was 4 (interquartile range 4-4) for phosphate buffered saline; 1 (interquartile range 1-3) for Biotene®; and ranged between 0 and 2 for the in-house composed mouthwashes. An in-house composed mouthwash (Placebo 6) performed best, with a growth score of 2 (interquartile range 2-3). Conclusions: All of the evaluated potential placebo mouthwashes were bacteriostatic after gonococcal exposure of 30 to 60 minutes. In-house composed Placebo 6 showed less inhibition on gonococcal growth than Biotene® and the other in-house placebos and demonstrates, in our opinion, a good trade-off between anti-gonococcal properties and taste.","Approved  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.  Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  This report by Van Dijck et al. seeks to evaluate the anti-gonococcal activity of several commercially available mouth washes, as well as of one commercial and several in-house produced 'placebo' mouth washes. The authors find that all tested commercially available mouth washes have some anti-gonococcal activity, and that some of the 'placebo' mouth washes did as well.  This study is important as mouth washes have been suggested as a potential tool for prevention of gonorrhoea on an individual and a population level. Trials examining the efficacy of oral mouth wash need a 'placebo' without anti-gonococcal activity. This report provides important data towards that. This brief report is clearly written. The conclusions are based on the data. The limitations of the small study are clearly described in the Discussion. I am a physician and epidemiologist and recommend that also a microbiologist should review the manuscript. I have a few minor comments: In the abstract it is not clear how the 5-point scale of N. gonorrhoeae growth is to be interpreted; make it explicit that 0 means no growth and 4 extensive growth.  The abstract mentions an IQR of 2-3 for placebo 6 at 60 minutes; Table 4 mentions an IQR of 1-3. Please check and correct.

- Results are only shown on Rainbow and do not appear to work for SAC (with reason) -- but does raise the question if the method is effective for other RL methods. 
- There is limited insight. Can the authors show that initializing Adam's parameters with 0 is better than using the parameters from the previous iteration in a more concrete way? Such as examining the behavior of the actual values. The fact that not resetting is seemingly better at low values of K suggests that not resetting can provide a reasonable initialization for the parameters of Adam.

The authors effectively communicate their ideas and concepts, ensuring clarity and coherence throughout the paper. The logical structure and well-reasoned arguments contribute to the overall quality of the essay. The article excels in providing the reader with a clear understanding of the problem's context and significance. By effectively conveying the goals and challenges of the study, the authors enhance the reader's comprehension of the subsequent experiments. Overall, the writing is of high quality, facilitating a smooth and engaging reading experience.

### Method
The paper presents an easy-to-use approach by introducing a method that is not only easy to implement, but also easy to apply, which enhances the potential adoption and practicality of the proposed approach.This user-friendly feature makes the method highly accessible and beneficial to researchers and practitioners in various fields.
The used code bases and hyperparameters are provided, allowing the results to be reproduced. While I appreciate the proposed method's ease of use, I believe that the authors could have conducted a more comprehensive and statistically rigorous analysis of their approach, considering its simplicity.
One notable limitation of the paper is the absence of confidence interval plots and statistical analysis, which could have been derived from \[1\], to enhance the clarity and precision of the findings. Incorporating these elements would have allowed readers to better understand the level of uncertainty associated with the reported results, thus bolstering the overall robustness of the study.
Furthermore, the authors only rely on a single seed for the initial analysis, without providing a compelling rationale for this choice. Although using a single seed can streamline the experimental process, it diminishes the validity of the findings by disregarding potential result variations arising from multiple seeds. A more thorough explanation or a comparison of outcomes based on different seeds would have added value to the introduction, ensuring a more comprehensive analysis.
I appreciate that the authors included continuous control tasks in their study; however, these tasks are not thoroughly explored. While the authors provide hypotheses to explain the unexpected results, a deeper analysis would have been expected.

In line 293, the authors reference a follow-up paper on resetting approaches but fail to cite the original work \[2\], which states in the section ""What and how to reset"" that resetting the optimizer has almost no significant impact due to quick updates of the moments. This contradicts the findings of this work.
Which brings me to the conclusion that I believe that the paper shows promise and the authors have taken a positive direction. However, in its current form, the paper falls short of being acceptable. It is essential to include comparisons to other baselines, such as \[2\], to provide a more thorough understanding of the opportunities and limitations, and to gain a clearer understanding of the internal effects in order to explain the aforementioned points.

The paper argues that solution methods in deep RL are best thought of as solving a sequence of optimization problems. And that the standard use of optimizers leads to ""contamination"" of the optimizer's internal parameters. The paper then proposes to reset the optimizer's internal parameters to fix this ""contamination."" Finally, the experiments on Atari show that resetting the optimizer's internal parameters leads to significant performance improvement. The main strength of the paper is that the key idea of the paper, resetting optimizer parameters at the beginning of each iteration, is simple and effective. I liked the general theme of the paper, i.e., we need to understand better the tools we borrow from other fields. The paper is well-written and easy to understand, making it accessible to a wide audience. The experiments in section 4.3 are performed on 55 Atarti games with ten seeds each, which might mean the results are statistically significant. Resetting seems to be beneficial for multiple optimizers like RMSprop, Adam and Rectified Adam.  The paper has two major weaknesses:
1. The paper claims at many points that a ""contamination"" effect plagues RL (for example, lines 107-109) and that many updates are wasted to unlearn the effects of the previous iteration. However, the paper does not describe what exactly this ""contamination"" means, and neither does it show the presence of any ""contamination."" All the paper shows is that there is a performance boost when we reset the optimizer's internal parameters. This performance boost is not direct evidence of contamination from iteration to iteration.

However, this weakness can be easily overcome. The paper first needs to contain a definition of ""contamination,"" maybe the authors mean that the internal parameters($m$ and $v$) are too far away from their true values at the beginning of each iteration. One way to measure this difference could be to measure the cosine similarity between the current value of $m$ and the true value of $m$. The true value can be measured by taking the gradient of all the samples in the buffer and taking steps using that gradient. A large difference between the true and current value of $m$ would mean contamination. The paper also suggests that this contamination is particularly large at the beginning of each iteration compared to a random time in the learning process. Again, this can be easily shown by showing that the difference in true $m$ and current $m$ is larger at the beginning of the iteration compared to any random time in the learning process. 

2. None of the results in the paper except the ones in section 4.3 are statistically significant. The paper only shows results for a single random seed. I should note that the authors are aware of this weakness (line 138). The best way to look at the current experiments in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 is that they are used to tune hyper-parameters for the experiments in Section 4.3. The authors might be limited in their computational resources, but in that case, it is better to present statistically significant results in smaller environments like MinAtar\[1\] than unreplicable results in a big environment. 

Other than these two main problems, there are a few other minor issues in the paper.
1. The update equations for Adam in Section 3 are wrong. Instead of using $m$ and $v$ for the final update, new variables $\hat{m}$ and $\hat{v}$ are used. See to the original Adam paper for the correct equations.  
2. Line 176 says that $K=1$ corresponds to vanilla gradient descent. But, that is not true. For $K=1$, the update is similar to the Rprop optimizer, not SGD. For $K=1$, the update only takes into account the sign of the partial derivative but not its magnitude. 
3. The value of $K$ is not properly tuned. In Figure 4, the difference between $K=1000$ and $K=500$ is insignificant. So, the optimal value of $K$ could be smaller. I suggest the authors also try smaller values of K, like 250, 125, etc. 

I like the ideas presented in the paper. However, I can not recommend accepting the paper in its current form in light of these weaknesses.

The key insight is that when using target networks for action-value function training, changes in the target parameters yield a change in the optimization problem the online parameters are solving. Because of that, the authors argue that preserving the adaptive optimizer statistics (e.g. of Adam) might or might not be desirable. The paper then studies the effect of resetting the optimizer state after (hard) target updates mostly using the Rainbow algorithm on Atari games as a testbed yielding a slight positive aggregate improvement. The main strength of the paper is the simplicity of the contribution; the paper is well-written and easy to follow, and the method is motivated and described well. The experimental protocol is solid: it uses the full set of 55 Atari games and a standard Rainbow implementation. The main weakness of the paper is the mixed empirical results. Granted, the median human-normalized performance improves from ~1.75 to ~2.25, however, per-game effects from resetting the optimizer are highly heterogeneous, yielding performance deterioration in ~14 environments. The soundness of the paper could have been higher if, at least, an explanation (supported by evidence) for the negative effects was given. Target network parameter updates indeed change the loss landscape that the online parameters are navigating. In addition to that, updating the replay buffer changes the distribution of inputs and hence the optimization problem for online parameters. Do you have ideas on how an optimizer could be changed to adapt to the input shifts? “We hypothesize that this can contaminate the internal parameters of the employed optimizer in situations where the optimization landscape of the previous iterations is quite different from the current iteration.” (L9) The reviewer didn’t find an empirical verification of this assumption.

Many deep RL algorithms use moving average target updates after each step instead of periodic hard updates. The authors demonstrate preliminary evidence that in soft actor-critic that uses such a practice, the optimizer resets do not improve the performance. Having said that, the reviewer appreciates the transparency about the negative results.

Again, one of the limitations is that in some environments resetting the optimizer yields negative results. It implies that a better alternative could be triggering the optimizer reset using a criterion (e.g. based on a measure of the loss landscape change / by performing a lookahead and assessing whether the reset was helpful)",397,0,0,0.7723,0.0420385675,0.8665425777,215,31.2684,0.2101,neurips,0.0505050505050505,2,3,2,3,factual,3,2,65,polite,4,negative,4,low,4,5,4,4,factual,4,4,88,polite,5,neutral,5,moderate,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,factual,3.0,4.0,80.0,polite,5.0,neutral,5.0,none,4,5,4,4,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low,3,5,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low

It improves the generalizability over various model architectures and tasks.

It is reasonable to assume that by leveraging flat minima on the multi-task learning setting, we could prevent over-fitting issue to the specific task or gradient intervention between different tasks.

The application of SAM on MTL requires some indirect adaptations. e.g. separate update rules for non-shared parts and shared part. The author successfully designed rules for each part. The statement of Theorem 1 is too intuitive, which does not require rigorous proof on it. At the right side of Theorem 1, maximum of maximum is utilized for deriving the upper bound. It is intuitive based on my knowledge.

The analytical decomposition of SAM gradient into 1) loss and 2) flatness parts are not novel at all. It is well known analysis based on existing methods (SAM, GSAM, GAM). Rather, The new modeling parts of SAM-MTL is gradient decomposition on each task and gradient aggregation based on whole tasks. However, i do not get convinced why these gradient decomposition and re-organization are required in the context of multi-task learning. This is not empirically validated by additional ablation studies.

In Figure 4, the author claim that suggested algorithms significantly improves the task-wise flatness than ERM algorithm. What if we conduct simple SAM on MTL, not based on your gradient decomposition and re-organization? I conjecture that the flatness would be similar to SAM-MTL, your method. The extensive comparison with SAM variants (SAM,GSAM,GAM) is required.

Please empirically provide the computation cost increments by applying SAM-MTL. SAM is well known for increasing the computation cost about 2 times than ERM. is there any other increments during the adaptation of SAM-MTL?

91,Reviewer-CubV,Improving Multi-task Learning via Seeking Task-based Flat Regions,"Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a widely used and powerful learning paradigm for training deep neural networks that allows learning more than one objective by a single backbone. Compared to training tasks separately, MTL significantly reduces computational costs, improves data efficiency, and potentially enhances model performance by leveraging knowledge across tasks. Hence, it has been adopted in a variety of applications, ranging from computer vision to natural language processing and speech recognition. Among them, there is an emerging line of work in MTL that focuses on manipulating the task gradient to derive an ultimate gradient descent direction to benefit all tasks. Despite achieving impressive results on many benchmarks, directly applying these approaches without using appropriate regularization techniques might lead to suboptimal solutions to real-world problems.

This is based on Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) by Foret et al. (2021), which was shown to reduce overfitting, and therefore could increase generalization performance across MTL tasks. The algorithm is based on solving a min-max optimization problem using Taylor expansion and gradient aggregation. Theorem establishes a generalization error bound. Experimental results on MTL computer vision tasks are provided. This is a well-rounded paper. It's an extension of SAM by Foret et al. (2021), but the application of SAM to MTL is well-motivated. The algorithm is simple and easy to understand, and the derivation in sections 4.3-4.4 is clear. Authors present both theoretical and experimental analysis. I also appreciate that the authors uploaded their code for reproducibility, and provided detailed explanation for their experimental setup as well as interpretation of the results. Please see questions below. 1. The paper lacks a critical discussion on the limitations of this method. For example, is the method computationally efficient?

The main novelty is that the authors propose to decompose the SAM gradient $g^\textrm{SAM}$ into the task-loss minimizing direction, $g^\textrm{loss}$ (obtained by directly taking the directive w.r.t. task loss), and the flat-region seeking direction, $g^\textrm{flat}\coloneqq g^\textrm{SAM}-g^\textrm{loss}$, and perform gradient aggregation on both separately.  The proposed method, i.e., running existing gradient-based MTL algorithms by aggregating $g^\textrm{SAM}$ and $g^\textrm{loss}$ separately, is evaluated on a set of datasets, on average demonstrating improved performance v.s. just using $g^\textrm{loss}$ for parameter update. 1. The paper is well-motivated and presented.  Although I do find frequent grammatical errors, the paper is easy to read and understand.
2. It is an interesting observation that decomposing $g^\textrm{SAM}$ into and $g^\textrm{loss}$ and $g^\textrm{flat}$ and aggregating them separately is crucial for the success of the proposed method.  But this decomposition is—in the way it is currently presented—purely heuristic.  I would have liked more analyses on this beyond the ablation study on page 9. 1. Second point in strengths.

2. The proofs and theorems—which the authors claim to be a major contribution of the present work and on which the proposed algorithm is supposedly based—are poorly presented.  In turn, without which, the proposed approach is largely heuristic and lack theoretical support (excluding results that have been established in prior work, i.e., the constituent component of SAM and gradient-based MTL methods).

    - The ""mild assumptions"" are not clearly stated nor justified.  E.g., theorem 2 used the assumption that the loss function is bounded by $L$, which is not mentioned anywhere except in the proof.  Also, please justify and elaborate on the assumption that ""that adding Gaussian perturbation will raise the test error"": is it required for all $\theta$, or local minima?  It would be best if the assumptions are listed explicitly.

    - The conclusion of theorem 3 looks wrong.  First of all, in the proof, the induction is incorrectly applied—the $\xi$ cannot alter between cases.  The $\log1/\delta$ term in $f^i$ should be $\log m/\delta$.  And, does the conclusion not follow theorem 2 directly via a simple union bound?

    - The outer $\max _ {\\|\epsilon_\textrm{sh}\\|<\rho_\textrm{sh}}$ in the statement of Theorem 1 and 3 does not make sense to me.  The max is taken over a vector of $m$ dimensions.  ~~Is the max coordinate-wise?  If so, it should go inside the square bracket.  If not,~~ is the max well-defined?  Or, how is the total order of the vector space defined?

3. Regardless of the above potential issue with the theorem statement, I fail to see the connection between Theorem 1 (or its complete version 3) and the approach in section 4.3, i.e., the idea that ""the worst-case shared perturbation $\epsilon_\mathrm{sh}$ is commonly learned for all tasks"".  Specifically, how is computing the worst-case perturbation on each task separately and then aggregate the gradients $\\{g^{i,\textrm{SAM}}_\textrm{sh}\\} _ {i\in m}$ related to the idea above?

4. As mentioend in point 1 of strengths, there are some grammatical issues and weird word choice that may lead to confusions.  E.g., what is the ""**ultimate** gradient descent direction"" (in the abstract)?  Also, ""is the compliment set"" --> ""is the complement set"".

170,Sangeeta-Saha,Simulation model for the dynamics of dengue with asymptomatic transmission and the effect of temperature,"Background: One of the fastest spreading vector-borne diseases in tropical and subtropical regions is dengue, which generates cost overruns for public health entities. Several factors can influence the dynamics of dengue virus transmission: environmental and climatic (abundance of vectors), interactions between hosts (infections by asymptomatic individuals), and population immunological factors. Given these conditions, it is necessary to carry out theoretical studies based on meteorological factors and asymptomatic transmission that are associated with both the existence of the vector and its incidence, in order to provide a scientific basis for health entities in decision-making. Methods: A mathematical model based on nonlinear ordinary differential equations is proposed to interpret the dynamics of dengue transmission in humans coupled to the dynamics of the Aedes aegypti species, considering the population of symptomatic and asymptomatic infected humans and the effect of temperature variability. The basic reproduction number was found and some simulation results based on the Runge-Kutta numerical method were obtained. Results: The simulations showed that the temperature had a directly proportional relationship with the basic reproduction number. The cases of infected people and carrier mosquitoes increased when the temperature peaks increased drastically; in low temperatures the infection persisted with low morbidity due to the survival of asymptomatic people. Conclusions: High temperatures tolerable by mosquitoes increase their life expectancy and their numbers in the environment which, together with a reservoir of asymptomatic infected people, leads to a higher incidence of the dengue virus in certain seasons or maintains its circulation in seasons of low temperatures, despite lower vector survival rates.","Not Approved  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.  Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  The authors, in the manuscript, have proposed a compartmental epidemic model of dengue transmission where the mosquito biting rate and the transmission rates from host to vector as well as vector to host are assumed to be temperature dependent. The calculations are basic ones and seem to be ok, but there are few points which I need to mention. Firstly, whenever a model is proposed, it is very important to show the biological well-posedness of the system. So, proving the non-negativity and boundedness of the system variables make the base on which the rest of the analysis is performed. Secondly, I am unable to understand how the transmission from mosquito to human depends on the temperature with two types of conditions (noted in equations 15 and 16). It could have been analysed appropriately. Moreover, it is not demonstrated properly how the time variable is connected with the temperature. So, a proper analysis of the second subfigures of each of Figure 2- Figure 4 could improve the work. Also, as per the model assumption, the parameter denoting 'the increase in female mosquito population' should also depend on temperature, but it is chosen as a constant value only. The reason supporting it needs to be mentioned. Altogether I have found the concept interesting, but the mentioned points, if taken care of, will make the work more strong and presentable only.

Humans are at risk owing to various routes of entry, including ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. While the toxicity of NPs is still debatable due to the scarcity of resources and research, most studies have concluded that NPs may exert toxicity, which exacerbates their neurotoxicity potential. Earlier studies concluded that NPs can cause oxidative stress, which results in apoptosis of neuronal cells. Some studies have shown that NPs can affect fundamental cell functions by inducing physical stress through deposition. Furthermore, studies on in vivo models exposed to NPs have demonstrated behavioral changes that are presumably due to alterations in acetylcholinesterase activity and neurotransmitter levels. This review discusses studies conducted on the neurotoxic potential of NPs and their effects, which are dependent on several parameters, including size and type of NPs, exposure concentration, duration, and various models at risk of NP exposure. Furthermore, speculations on how NPs are related to neurotoxicity are also discussed.","Approved With Reservations  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.  Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  The review addresses the increasingly relevant topic of the neurotoxic potential of nanoplastics (NPs) in the context of escalating plastic pollution, effectively summarizing key findings from the literature with an emphasis on the various exposure routes and associated risks. However, the manuscript would benefit from a more comprehensive synthesis of the existing literature, particularly in addressing the inconsistencies and gaps in current research, while also providing a clearer articulation of the limitations of current research methodologies and offering suggestions for future studies. Additionally, a discussion of the broader implications for public health and potential regulatory frameworks would strengthen the manuscript's contribution to the field. Overall, the review could be further improved by deepening the analysis of existing studies and providing a more critical perspective on the current state of knowledge. I recommend that the authors consider resubmitting after making significant improvements. Major comments While the review discusses various detection and quantification methods for NPs, a more detailed critique of the limitations of these methodologies is needed. This should include an examination of the challenges related to detecting NPs in environmental samples versus laboratory conditions, as well as the implications these limitations have for interpreting research findings. The manuscript needs a more critical analysis of key research gaps, especially concerning the inconsistencies in findings related to the mechanisms of NP-induced neurotoxicity. Strengthening this section with a more detailed comparison of the outcomes across different experimental models and conditions would greatly enhance the review's contribution. The discussion on the mechanisms of NP-induced neurotoxicity is crucial. For instance, exploring the specific biochemical pathways through which NPs interact with cellular components at a molecular level would provide a more comprehensive understanding.  The role of protein corona formation in neurotoxicity, mentioned towards the end, should be integrated earlier in the manuscript to establish a clear connection between NP exposure and neurodegenerative diseases. While the manuscript covers many trending topics, it often treats them in isolation, which leads to a lack of coherence. An integrated approach that links these topics and demonstrates their interconnections would greatly improve the flow and continuity of the review. Minor comments The manuscript relies heavily on older studies, with relatively few references from the past three years. Incorporating more recent studies will ensure that the review reflects the current state of research and provides a comprehensive overview of the field. In some sections, particularly those discussing in vivo studies, the outcomes are not always clearly connected to the broader implications for neurotoxicity. It would be helpful to more explicitly link the results of these studies to the potential mechanisms of NP-induced neurotoxicity and their relevance to human health. The conclusion primarily restates the findings discussed throughout the review but does not provide a comprehensive synthesis of the key takeaways. The summary of neurotoxicity of NPs in different models presented in Table 1 is not comprehensive and should be thoroughly enumerated. The language of the manuscript should be polished.

59,Reviewer-4HBq,Double-I Watermark: Protecting Model Copyright for LLM Fine-tuning,"To support various applications, business owners often seek the customized models that are obtained by fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM through the API provided by LLM owners or cloud servers. However, this process carries a substantial risk of model misuse, potentially resulting in severe economic consequences for business owners. Thus, safeguarding the copyright of these customized models during LLM fine-tuning has become an urgent practical requirement, but there are limited existing solutions to provide such protection. To tackle this pressing issue, we propose a novel watermarking approach named ""Double-I watermark"". Specifically, based on the instruct-tuning data, two types of backdoor data paradigms are introduced with trigger in the instruction and the input, respectively. By leveraging LLM's learning capability to incorporate customized backdoor samples into the dataset, the proposed approach effectively injects specific watermarking information into the customized model during fine-tuning, which makes it easy to inject and verify watermarks in commercial scenarios. We evaluate the proposed ""Double-I watermark"" under various fine-tuning methods, demonstrating its harmlessness, robustness, uniqueness, imperceptibility, and validity through both theoretical analysis and experimental verification.","With the rapid development in Large Language Models (LLMs), business owners are increasingly exploring the customization of pre-trained LLMs through APIs provided by LLM owners or cloud servers. However, this process carries substantial risks of model misuse, making the protection of copyrights for these customized models a pressing issue. Currently, the majority of LLM watermarking research concentrates on small-scale models for specific tasks or pre-trained models, and these methods unsuitable for customized LLMs. The application scenarios of customized LLMs present new challenges for watermarking techniques: they must not degrade model performance while maintaining watermark uniqueness and imperceptibility. Most crucially, since the watermarking embedding process can't access the full model parameters, the model remains a black box for those embedding the watermark. To address these challenges, the authors propose an efficient and robust watermarking embedding method tailored for customized LLMs. By designing two types of backdoor data paradigms with triggers in the instruction and input and mixing them with the normal training data during the fine-tuning process, the model can learn unique knowledge related to watermarking. Owners can then verify their ownership by guiding the model to produce specific outputs using a unique trigger. Furthermore, the authors ensure the effectiveness of this method through theoretical analysis and experimental verification. 1. The article is well-structured, starting with a thorough discussion on the shortcomings of naive backdoor-type watermarking methods before delving into their novel DOUBLE-I WATERMARKING FRAMEWORK. This logical progression effectively addresses the challenges initially posed.
2. The authors introduce a BACKDOOR DATA PARADIGM that aptly fulfills the requirements for Uniqueness and Imperceptibility in watermark embedding. The overall problem is framed as a judgment question, further enhancing the method's Uniqueness and Efficiency.
3. The paper features extensive experiments that convincingly validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Beyond this, the authors conduct a multifaceted set of tests, including a non-harmful test to ensure that the watermark embedding does not significantly degrade model performance, robustness tests against second-time fine-tuning and model quantization, and an ablation study concerning the reference set to further substantiate the rationality of their backdoor data framework design. 1. As pointed out by the authors in section 3.3.1 ""TRIGGER IN 'INPUT' KEY,"" decorations can utilize specific keywords or phrases that are rare in regular instructions. Such rarity, however, could potentially be a drawback for these types of watermarking methods. Given that the target environment is cloud-based LLMs, providers could preprocess user inputs to filter out these decorations and triggers, thereby causing erroneous verifications. The design of triggers, in this context, warrants a more nuanced discussion by the authors.

2. In section 3.3.3 ""THE MIX-UP OF MULTIPLE TYPES,"" the authors mention that ""it is possible to embed multiple Double-I watermarks in a model, which theoretically has the potential to enhance the robustness of our watermarking technique."" The theoretical substantiation for this claim is lacking, especially considering that multiple types of watermarks could interact and affect each other. More theoretical proofs or appropriate literature citations are needed to validate this assertion.

Addressing challenges such as watermark uniqueness, imperceptibility, and robustness against removal attacks, the ""Double-I watermark"" method introduces two types of backdoor data paradigms. These paradigms effectively embed watermarking information into the model, ensuring the watermark's presence is imperceptible yet detectable. The method is thoroughly evaluated, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining the model’s performance, robustness against attacks, and overall practical applicability for protecting the intellectual property of customized LLMs in various applications. Here are some potential strengths discussed in the paper: 
1. Robustness Against Removal Attacks: The proposed ""Double-I watermark"" method has been designed to be robust against attacks aimed at removing the watermark, ensuring that copyright protection remains intact even under adversarial conditions.
2. Imperceptibility and Uniqueness: The watermark introduced by the method is imperceptible, meaning it doesn’t affect the model's normal functionality or output, and it is unique, allowing for clear identification and copyright protection of the customized LLMs.
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper includes a thorough evaluation of the proposed method, assessing various aspects such as harmlessness, robustness, uniqueness, and efficiency, demonstrating the method’s practical viability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios. 1. Limited Exploration of Attacks: The paper primarily focuses on second-time fine-tuning and model quantization as watermark removal attacks. The exploration of other potential attacks,such as pruning, that might be used to remove or alter the watermark seems limited.

2. Dependency on Specific Paradigms: The watermarking method relies on specific paradigms for embedding the watermark, and its effectiveness might be influenced by the choice of these paradigms, limiting its flexibility and adaptability.

3. Uniqueness Challenges: The paper mentions challenges in ensuring the uniqueness of the watermark, particularly in distinguishing whether certain behaviors stem from the model’s inherent traits or the embedded watermark. 1. Regarding Model Manipulation:
Could you clarify the resilience of the watermarking method against potential manipulations, such as adding conditional statements in the code to filter or alter specific inputs, especially when there is knowledge of how the watermarking works?

2. Concerning Training Data and Time:
Could you provide more details on the amount of training data required and the duration needed to effectively watermark a model using your proposed method? Is there a significant amount of data and time needed for this process?

3. On the Necessity of Fine-Tuning:
Is it possible to implement the watermarking method without resorting to fine-tuning the model? How does the method ensure that the model remains general and unbiased, especially when the question-answer pairs used for watermarking are not as diverse as those in the original training set, such as OpenAI’s non-public dataset?",444,0,8,0.8097000000000001,0.1072108844,0.8502570391000001,48,5.7905,0.33,iclr,0.0,1,4,4,0,unfactual,3,1,64,polite,3,positive,3,high,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,95,5,5,5,5,3,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,factual,3.0,4.0,80.0,polite,5.0,positive,5.0,none,3,4,4,3,factual,4,4,80,polite,5,positive,4,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low

2. Lack of introduction of related work. Various black box model watermarking schemes have been proposed recently, including LLM watermarking, while the most recent model watermarking scheme cited in this paper is published in 2019.

168,Reviewer-XYg3,Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation via Joint Error based Triplet Alignment,"Existing domain adaptation methods are very effective in aligning feature distributions. However, these techniques usually do not improve the performance that much when a few annotated examples are available in the target domain. To address this semi-supervised domain adaptation scenario, we propose a novel joint error based triplet alignment approach that simultaneously optimizes the classification loss as well as the joint error among the source, labeled and unlabeled target domains. Besides, we propose a novel dissimilarity measurement between two classifiers, namely maximum cross margin discrepancy, which can asymptotically bridge the gap between the theory and algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our method over several baselines.","The paper presents a new framework for semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) that establishes an upper bound on target error. This framework introduces a method called Joint Error-based Triplet Alignment (JTA), which performs alignments not only between the labeled source domain and the unlabeled target domain but also between the labeled source domain and the labeled target domain. As a result, their empirical studies demonstrate that JTA can reduce domain gaps and enhance feature learning by explicitly considering the alignment for the labeled target data. The paper also introduces a dissimilarity metric known as Maximum Cross Margin Discrepancy (MCMD) to bridge the gap between theory and algorithm, ensuring the consistency of the target error bound. The main problem of this paper is the lack of sufficient details to understand and follow their motivation and derivation. Given the promising empirical results presented in the paper, I strongly recommend that the authors consider a complete rewrite of the paper, focusing on delivering a clear and well-motivated presentation. This should involve providing comprehensive derivations with sufficient details or citations, ensuring that each step of each equation is transparently explained for the benefit of the reader's understanding. The performance of the proposed work is promising. 1. I find the paper's motivation unclear. To be specific, the upper bound of the hypothesis regarding the unlabeled target domain should be the most crucial starting point for readers to comprehend what the proposed method aims to address. However, the lack of an explanation for the proof of Equation (1) makes it extremely difficult for me to grasp and follow. Concerning D.1, I am unsure how the first equation of the unlabeled target error bound was derived. If it stems from Ben David's theorem (assuming my recollection is accurate, Ben David did not derive any error bound under semi-supervised settings) or the work of others, it would be beneficial to provide citations so that readers can fully contextualize and understand the subject matter.

2. What is the source of the intractability, particularly for f_{S} and f_{V}? Given that both S and V are fully labeled, it seems reasonable to assume that a straightforward optimization approach like empirical risk minimization (ERM) could yield a reasonable approximation for f_{S} and f_{V). The mention of intractability is often made within the framework of variational inference, where certain integrations cannot be feasibly solved. Providing a clear explanation of this intractability would significantly enhance the paper's motivation.

3. How is the reduction of the error term achieved between two fixed true labeling functions? I want to emphasize that ""true"" here means unchanging or fixed. The paper is proving a complex upper bound derivation, and its clarity is hindered by inconsistent definitions throughout, making it difficult to follow.

4. The t-SNE visualization, without any indications of the class labels for each data sample, fails to convey meaningful information. In fact, I find the t-SNE visualization rather perplexing. I recommend that the authors consider sharing the code for their implementation with the reviewers. This would serve not only to confirm the reproducibility of their work but also to enhance the reviewers' understanding of the proposed methodology.

5. The experimental setup lacks clarity, particularly in the context of semi-supervised domain adaptation, where the number of labeled target samples and the way to select the labeled target sample are crucial. It is important to provide sufficient details regarding the sample selection process. 

6. The authors assert that \[1\] violates the triangle inequality without providing a thorough explanation or derivation. This is a strong claim, as it implies \[1\] is a departure from well-established theoretical foundations, especially considering that \[1\] is published on a top tire. To support their claim, the authors should conduct in-depth elaboration and studies.

Could you please clarify what is meant by the conditional distribution referred to in Section 3.1? To be specific, which random variables are conditioned on which other random variables? Based on the authors’ preliminary at the beginning of the section that both f_{S} and f_{V} are true labeling functions (true means fixed and deterministic). Meanwhile, I am confused by the idea of describing a mapping function (mapping function is normally deterministic) as a distribution (sampling from a distribution is stochastic). How come a stochastic term can be used to describe a deterministic notation? Can you elaborate on this?

2. To me, the loss introduced in this work appears to be an extension of the one (MDD) presented in \[1\] to the semi-supervised setting. I would appreciate it if the authors could offer a comprehensive discussion outlining the primary distinctions between \[1\] and their proposed approach, excluding the consideration of the semi-supervised setting and the violation of the triangle inequality.

To do this, the researchers created a dataset of stories from 24 cognitive science papers, annotating each story with factors that influence people's judgments, such as norm violations and the avoidability or inevitability of harm.

The authors find that, on an aggregate level, the alignment between LLMs and human intuition has improved with newer models. However, statistical analyses reveal that LLMs and humans weigh these factors differently when making judgments. 
 
**Originality**: The paper presents an interesting approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs) by testing their ability to handle tasks related to causal judgments and moral permissibility. The authors have transcribed stories from various papers and used them to test the LLMs, focusing on several factors that influence people's causal judgments and moral dilemmas. This approach is original and provides a new perspective on the capabilities of LLMs.

**Quality**: The authors have meticulously transcribed stories from a number of papers, ensuring a wide range of scenarios for testing the LLMs. They have also collected responses for each story from a crowd-sourcing platform, ensuring a diverse set of responses for analysis. 

**Clarity**: The paper is written in a clear and understandable manner. The authors have explained their methodology and the factors they focused on in a detailed and comprehensible way. 

**Significance**: The paper contributes to understanding how LLMs handle complex tasks related to causality and morality. This is an important area of research, given the increasing use of LLMs in various applications. The insights gained from this study could be useful for improving these models in the future. The paper also opens up new avenues for research in this area.
 There are a few areas where it could be improved:

1. **Evaluating with more models**: The paper is a bit skewed towards OpenAI models (GPT3 and beyond) for the evaluation. Including more diverse models could provide a more comprehensive understanding of how different LLMs perform on the tasks. This could also help identify whether the observed behaviors are specific to these models or are more generally applicable to LLMs.

2. **Comparing with human performance**: While the paper does a good job of comparing the performance of different LLMs, it does not provide a clear comparison with human performance. This makes it difficult to assess how close the models are to human-level performance on these tasks. Including a human baseline could provide a more meaningful context for the results.

3. **Analyzing incorrect predictions**: The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the models' incorrect predictions. This could help identify common patterns or biases in the models' errors, which could provide insights for improving the models.

4. **Generalizability of findings**: The paper's findings are based on a specific set of stories and tasks. It's unclear how generalizable these findings are to other tasks or domains. The authors could address this by testing the models on a wider range of tasks or by discussing the limitations of their approach in more detail.
 1. **Evaluating with more models**: The paper primarily focuses on GPT-type models and its variants. Could the authors elaborate on why they chose to focus on these models? Would the inclusion of other language models provide different insights? 

2. **Comparing with human performance**: The paper lacks a clear comparison with human performance. Could the authors provide a human baseline for these tasks? This could help in understanding how close the models are to achieving human-level performance.

3. **Analyzing incorrect predictions**:  The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the models' incorrect predictions. Could the authors provide more insights into the common patterns or biases in the models' errors? This could potentially help in improving the models.

4. **Generalizability of findings**: The findings of the paper are based on a specific set of stories and tasks. Could the authors discuss how generalizable these findings are to other tasks or domains? 

5. **Interpretability and transparency**: The paper presents an analysis of how LLMs reason about causality and morality. However, it's not clear how these insights can be used to improve the interpretability and transparency of these models. Could the authors provide some thoughts on this?
 The paper addresses the limitations of the work and potential negative societal impact, although not in a dedicated section. The authors acknowledge that their focus is narrow and only on certain aspects of alignment with humans. They caution that their work should not be used to make sweeping and general statements about AI-human alignment. They also note that their moral permissibility task is not a certification task and should not be used as a flat benchmark to beat.

The authors also discuss the ethical considerations of their work, emphasizing the importance of assessing implicit intuitions underlying commonsense reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs), especially in cases related to morality. They acknowledge that even if a model is not explicitly given the responsibility to make moral judgments, these judgments can appear across many forms of freely generated text. They also recognize the potential for replicating human biases in LLMs and state that this is something they would want to avoid.

In terms of potential negative societal impact, the authors don't explicitly discuss this. However, they do acknowledge the potential for misuse of LLMs and the ethical considerations that come with their use. They also discuss the importance of transparency and consent in their data collection process.

This paper investigates to what extent LLMs can align with human intuitions when making causal and moral judgments. To do this, they collected a dataset of stories from 24 cognitive science papers and created a causal and moral judgment challenge set. They evaluate different LLMs about their alignment with humans and reveal that the implicit preferences can be different even for LLMs trained with the same technique. They find that increasing model sizes actually impact those models’ aggregate-level alignment differently.
 With the wide spread of LLMs, to understand the alignment between humans and models is an important topic. In this paper:
- They have provided a dataset to understand the human-model alignment, especially in the causal and moral judgment perspective.
- The resources are from cognitive studies which makes it more reliable than the normal text resources.
  The paper wants to analyze the alignment between humans and models, however it lacks some description of how they conducted the human study.
 - For the factors in Table 2, are they from existing literature reviews or summarized by the authors? 
- For the dataset, are those factor labels annotated by the authors or by original cognitive scientists? 
- For the human participants, do you have any criteria to select who can participate in the survey?

On the aggregate level, alignment has improved with more recent LLMs. However, using statistical analyses, we find that LLMs weigh the different factors quite differently from human participants. These results show how curated, challenge datasets combined with insights from cognitive science can help us go beyond comparisons based merely on aggregate metrics: we uncover LLMs implicit tendencies and show to what extent these align with human intuitions.","This model presents a new challenge set of hard edge cases intended to test models understanding of the nuances of the directness of causation and moral culpability, by collecting them from a set of cognitive science papers. This has the clever effect of not only getting challenging stories, but those which would vary along specific features important to humans.

They test LLMs on those outputs to measure agreement with human intuitions; and annotate those cases for a set of features so that one could draw insight from those disagreements. 

 It is a well-written and well-considered paper which both presents a new useful challenge set, and utilizes it to provide interesting analysis of LLM tendencies in causal culpability and moral judgments.  It could clearly lead to further uses both in the evaluation of new models and in further analysis. The literature review is, as far as I could tell, comprehensive. 

The work seem rigorous throughout - I appreciate the thorough explorations with personas and automatic prompt engineering, which alleviate worries about the normal fickleness of prompt choice.   - The size of the challenge set (around 200 stories I believe) is somewhat limited; I don't think that that's too much of a worry for such a challenge set, so I wouldn't view it as a major weakness. 
- quibble: A seemingly left-over note on line 232: "" This is very very interesing, make the flow better."" - I'd be very curious about which personas and prompts would lead to worst-case performance for various models, since that might give insight into how the models go awry. 
- The improvements in alignment with human judgements from adopting a utilitarian/consequentialist framing is fascinating. However, that doesn't mean that all humans have a utiliarian framing.  Is there any concern that measuring against the average of human judgements might ignore variance between different humans on such judgement tasks? 
 The ethical considerations section seems thoughtful, and I see no unaddressed limitations.

115,Reviewer-DYrH,MoCa: Measuring Human-Language Model Alignment on Causal and Moral Judgment Tasks,"Human commonsense understanding of the physical and social world is organized around intuitive theories. These theories support making causal and moral judgments. When something bad happens, we naturally ask: who did what, and why? A rich literature in cognitive science has studied people's causal and moral intuitions. This work has revealed a number of factors that systematically influence people's judgments, such as the violation of norms and whether the harm is avoidable or inevitable. We collected a dataset of stories from 24 cognitive science papers and developed a system to annotate each story with the factors they investigated. Using this dataset, we test whether large language models (LLMs) make causal and moral judgments about text-based scenarios that align with those of human participants. On the aggregate level, alignment has improved with more recent LLMs. However, using statistical analyses, we find that LLMs weigh the different factors quite differently from human participants. These results show how curated, challenge datasets combined with insights from cognitive science can help us go beyond comparisons based merely on aggregate metrics: we uncover LLMs implicit tendencies and show to what extent these align with human intuitions.","This paper focused on large language models' causal and moral intuitions and investigated the alignment between LLMs and humans' causal and moral judgments. For this purpose, the authors collected story datasets from the field of cognitive science and manually annotated each story with human judgments and underlying latent factors. Based on this dataset, a diverse range of LLMs with different model scales and training methods are evaluated. The authors then statistically revealed that LLMs weigh factors differently than humans, indicating divergent implicit preferences and emphasizing the importance of curated datasets and cognitive science insights in understanding model preferences and alignment. * This paper is well-motivated by philosophy and cognitive science and focused on an exciting topic, LLMs' causal and moral intuitions. Such an interdisciplinary insight would benefit the better understanding of LLMs' behaviours.
* The authors summarized a systematic framework of the underly latent factors of casual and moral judgements based on cognitive science, which might help improve the interpretability of LLMs.
* The constructed judgment dataset is high-quality, with a well-designed annotation protocol and high inter-rater agreement (>0.8).
* The authors benchmarked the alignment level between humans and a wide range of LLMs. They also conducted comprehensive analyses and made inspiring conclusions like those in Sec. 4.2.2, e.g., differences in Benefits. * The constructed dataset is too small, and the coverage is limited. Two hundred six instances are highly insufficient to investigate LLMs' properties which might make the conclusion biased. This can be observed in Table 3 (a). The relatively high bootstrapped confidence interval indicates a high variance and unreliable results. This is my biggest concern of this work.

* Some essential results need more in-depth analysis and explanation. (1) The unnatural results in Table 3(a) need more analysis. Why did the aligned and larger Alpaca-7B get lower Agg than GPT3-curie-v1 on Causal Judgement? Why did davinci-002 outperform the well-aligned davinci-003 on moral judgement？ (2) The authors should provide some (even initial) analysis of the differences introduced in Sec. 4.2.2 though they are attractive. * How do you explain the unnatural results in Table 3(a): the aligned and larger Alpaca-7B got lower Agg than GPT3-curie-v1 on Causal Judgement; GPT-4 performed even worse than davinci-003 on Causal Judgement; davinci-002 outperformed the well-aligned davinci-003 on moral judgement.

154,Reviewer-5GRr,Recovering Unbalanced Communities in the Stochastic Block Model with Application to Clustering with a Faulty Oracle,"The stochastic block model (SBM) is a fundamental model for studying graph clustering or community detection in networks. It has received great attention in the last decade and the balanced case, i.e., assuming all clusters have large size, has been well studied. 
However, our understanding of SBM with unbalanced communities (arguably, more relevant in practice) is still limited. In this paper, we provide a simple SVD-based algorithm for recovering the communities in the SBM with communities of varying sizes.
We improve upon a result of Ailon, Chen and Xu [ICML 2013; JMLR 2015] by removing the assumption that there is a large interval such that the sizes of clusters do not fall in, and also remove the dependency of the size of the recoverable clusters on the number of underlying clusters. We further complement our theoretical improvements with experimental comparisons.
Under the planted clique conjecture, the size of the clusters that can be recovered by our algorithm is nearly optimal (up to poly-logarithmic factors) when the probability parameters are constant. 

As a byproduct, we obtain an efficient clustering algorithm with sublinear query complexity in a faulty oracle model, which is capable of detecting all clusters larger than $\tilde{\Omega}({\sqrt{n}})$, even in the presence of $\Omega(n)$ small clusters in the graph. In contrast, previous efficient algorithms that use a sublinear number of queries are incapable of recovering any large clusters if there are more than $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{2/5})$ small clusters.","This paper studies a classic problem of recovering clusters in a random graph. Concretely, the authors consider the stochastic block model. Here there is an underlying graph on n nodes. The n nodes are partitioned into k unknown clusters. There is then an edge independently between any two nodes in the same cluster with probability p and between any two in different clusters with probability q < p.

This is an extensively studied problem and many algorithms have been designed that allow the recovery of all clusters of a reasonable size (somewhat larger than sqrt(n), which is anyway a requirement for computational efficiency under the planted clique conjecture). The previous state of the art allows recovering clusters under two assumptions (here simplified for clarity and brevity):

1. The clusters to recover have size at least max(sqrt(n), k)/(p-q).
2. There is a number alpha of about sqrt(n)/(p-q) such that no cluster has size in the interval \[alpha/C, alpha\] for a constant C.

The assumption that the cluster sizes are at least sqrt(n) for those to be recovered is natural as mentioned above. However, the dependency on k is unfortunate when there are many small clusters. These would prevent the recovery of medium sizes clusters when k >> sqrt(n). Secondly, the assumption about the empty interval is quite unnatural.

The main contribution of this work is to remove the dependency on k in 1. and to remove the assumption 2. all together.

The authors also present applications of their algorithm in the related problem of clustering with a faulty oracle. Here one can ask whether two nodes v, w are in the same cluster or not. One is then returned a noise answer. Here the paper also improves over the state of the art in terms of the cardinality of clusters that can be recovered. -The problem studied is fundamental in graph clustering.
-Removing the dependency on k and the requirement of an empty interval of cluster sizes is significant and the algorithm guarantees of the algorithm much more natural than previously
-The authors have implemented their algorithm and compared experimentally to previous work. The comparison is overall in favour of the new algorithm. -I know this is a theoretical contribution, and also the authors probably did not attempt to optimize constants that much, but a factor 2^13 in the guarantees is quite severe in practice. Hopefully and probably, this constant is smaller in practice. -Could you say a bit about the running time of your algorithm in practice compared to previous work?
-Can you comment on whether the 2^13 constant can be reduced to a more reasonable constant without too much effort?

 The same. Maybe the authors could precise the complexity of the algorithm 1. In experiment 6 it seems the authors are able to run this algorithm for n substantially larger than the other experiments. The authors could go to higher n and test how tight are their bounds; in particular taking p and q smaller.

A small section to conclude the article and for future work would be appreciable.

The paper proposes a stepwise method of recovering the large clusters in the presence of small clusters for planted clique SBM and faulty oracle models. The main strengths of the paper are as follows - 

(1) The paper addresses a gap in the literature on the simultaneous recovery of large and small communities in networks.

(2) The paper deals with the problem of community recovery of large communities in the presence of small communities. The paper provides a stepwise method of recovering large communities in planted clique SBM and faulty oracle models.

(3) The paper provides theoretical results supporting the recovery of large communities by overcoming the ""small cluster barrier"" of the size of the remaining small clusters.

(3) The stopping criterion of the proposed algorithm is not clear. 
 (1) Does the proposed algorithm assume the knowledge of p and q?

(2) Does the proposed algorithm assume the knowledge of the number of communities, or is there a stopping criteria of the proposed algorithm for recovery of the number of large communities?

Accurate estimation of such small probabilities is of utmost importance across diverse domains. Conventional Monte Carlo methods are inefficient, demanding an exorbitant number of samples to achieve reliable estimates. Inspired by the exact sampling capabilities of normalizing flows, we revisit this challenge and propose normalizing flow assisted importance sampling, termed NOFIS.

Next, it estimates the rare event probability by utilizing importance sampling in conjunction with the last proposal.

For this they parameterize the rare event set via a function $g$ such that the rare event set is the set of points where $g \leq 0$. Then they introduce a sequence of decreasing sets $\Omega_{a_i}$ such that this goes to $\Omega$ for $i = M$. Now a normalizing flow is trained for approximate each set $\Omega_{a_i}$, which corresponds to a temperature schedule for the rare event probability measure.  The normalizing flows are trained each on their own using the reverse KL and then the weights up to flow $i-1$ are frozen for training the flow $i$. The approach is benchmarked against other rare event sampling methods such as SUS, SIR, .. on toy examples of varying information. The paper does a good job at explaining its approach. The experimental results seem impressive and its design choices seem well-motivated via ablation studies. Furthermore, using a normalizing flows makes a lot of sense for this kind of task. 1) I am not convinced of the novelty of this approach. This paper mostly cites pre 2021 papers. Please clarify the relation to more modern approaches such as \[1,2\]. 

2) The flows are trained with the reverse KL. This comes with some caveats. First one assumes differentiability of the function $g$. Please comment on whether this is realistic. Furthermore, the reverse KL is known to be mode seeking. I think for most applications in the field of rare event sampling it is crucial to cover all the modes of a density. There has been some recent line of work for normalizing flows such as \[3\] to overcome this but this seems like a major limitation. 

3) Similarly, the evaluation should also include some measure of the distance to the true measure and not only the estimated probability. As far as I understand the paper, this should be possible. 

4) Please also cite relevant papers such as \[4\], who introduced a kind of log det schedule for covering multimodal distributions, which I think is related to way the different $\Omega_{a_i}$ are constructed. 

5) This paper does not come with any code. Do the authors intend to make their code public? Appendix C does not suffice for reproducibility in my opinion. 

6) The heuristic why MCMC wont cut it for this problem makes sense for vanilla MH. But if one takes gradient informed steps such as HMC or MALA, I am not sure why this rationale outlined in section 3.3 should hold true. What is the proposal for MCMC taken in the experiments?

This is done by the normalizing flow model learning proposal distributions, then estimating rare event probability using importance sampling on the learned proposal distribution. Paper is well presented, and using normalizing flows to assist with importance sampling (as compared to the other way around which has been done) is new. Freezing seems to provide only a marginal advantage over non-freezing. The main advantage as the authors proposed is in the speed, but that's not particularly central to the paper as speed is measured by function calls and not wall clock time. If we remove step 5 from NOFIS then most of the method is not particularly distinguishable from standard normalizing flows.

In addition, if we're looking for just samples from the proposal distribution, what's the advantage of using NFs over other generative models?

However, the authors have not referred to it or provided a detailed comparison, and I strongly recommend that they compare and discuss their work in relation to these existing studies.
- It seems that the graph kernel in the paper is not learnable, which results in the quality of the supergraph construction being entirely dependent on the learned node representations and the chosen threshold. Turning the graph kernel into a learnable component could be a better approach.

Experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to many baselines including supervised GCNs, label propagation, graph contrastive learning, etc.","The paper presented a semi-supervised method for graph classification. The proposed model is composed of two GCNs, one is for individual graphs and the other is for a super graph of all graphs, where the super graph is constructed by a graph kernel. The proposed method is compared with its competitors such as graph contrastive learning on benchmark datasets, where different labeling rates have been considered. 1. The problem studied in the paper, namely graph-level semi-supervised learning with scarce labels, is an important and challenging problem. 
2. The proposed method is based on a double-level GCN model, which has two GCNs. The first one performs graph convolution for each graph and the second one performs graph convolution for a global graph defined (by graph kernel) over all the graphs. This idea is very novel and appealing.
3. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods such as SimGRACE and GLA as well as classical methods such as GCN and WL kernel. It has competitive performance.
4. The proposed method is simple and easy to implement. 1. The authors claimed that their method has fewer hyperparameters but they did not provide specific comparison with other methods such as GLA in terms of the number of hyperparameters. 
2. The similarity graph among graphs is constructed by a graph kernel such as WL-subtree kernel and there are two different post-processing method for $\mathcal{K}$. it is not clear which one is better and which one was used in the experiments. 
3. The writing can be further improved. 1. At the beginning of Section 3.1, $\mathbf{S}$ is a binary matrix. However, in Section 3.3, the kernel matrix given by a graph kernel may not be binary or sparse. Do the sparsification and binarization have a significant impact on the performance of the proposed method? 
2. In Section 4.2, the authors set $d=d’=64$. Is this the best setting? How do $d$ and $d’$ as well as $d’’$ influence the classification accuracy?
3. What are the numbers of layers in the two GNNs in the experiments? Does the depth matter?
4. In Figure 2, the two post-processing methods for the global kernel matrix are compared. It seems that the one related to $c$ is better than the one related to $\tau$. I wonder if the authors reported the results of the method related to $c$ in Tables 2, 3, and 
5. It is not clear why the authors did not include the results of larger labeling rates such as 30% or 50%.
6. Are their any time cost comparison?
7. In Table 4, it seems that the performance of graphlet sampling kernel is always the worst. I suggest the authors discuss the difference between graphlet sampling kernel and other kernels.
8. It is necessary to compare the number of hyperperameters of the proposed method with those of the baselines. In the proposed method, one has to determine $c$ or $\tau$, which affect the classification performance.",488,0,14,0.7129000000000001,0.0987179487,0.960095048,51,60.5127,0.1507,iclr,0.0,5,5,5,5,factual,5,5,95,polite,5,neutral,5,none,5,4,4,5,partially factual,5,5,88,polite,5,neutral,5,moderate,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,factual,3.0,4.0,80.0,polite,4.0,neutral,5.0,low,4,4,4,4,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,positive,5,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low

The authors propose a semi-supervised graph classification method called KDGCN, which consists of two GCN modules. The first GCN module obtains feature vectors for each graph through a readout operation. Then, the authors construct a supergraph using graph kernels. The second GCN module employs a semi-supervised approach to learn meta-node representations on the supergraph, capturing sufficient structural information from both labeled and unlabeled graphs. Typically, semi-supervised methods based on graph contrastive learning result in complex models and intricate hyperparameter-tuning. However, the method proposed by the authors has fewer hyperparameters and is easy to implement. - The paper is overall easy to understand.
- The idea of constructing a supergraph is novel and interesting.
- When graph labels are extremely scarce, the proposed method has shown some improvements on certain datasets. - The section about supergraph construction mentions using a predefined similarity threshold (τ) to determine the existence of edges, but it does not explain how to select this threshold.
- While the experiments demonstrate that the WL subtree kernel performs well in certain cases, should the paper provide a more detailed comparison and analysis to explain why this kernel was chosen over other possible kernels? - Can more information be provided to explain the structure and properties of the supergraph and how it impacts the method's performance?

 1. The approach of aggregation considers the entire path, not only a state, is novel and unique.

2. The PTSA algorithm presented in this paper can be applied with any other state abstraction functions mentioned in previous studies, in a general way.

3. The paper provides extensive experimental data. It includes environments such as Atari games, as well as tasks with continuous action spaces like CartPole and LunarLander, and board games like Gomoku. The rich variety of experimental environments demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method across various tasks.

4. Integrate PTSA with state-of-the-art algorithms can achieve comparable performance with smaller branching factors. In other words, PTSA provides a more efficient method with less computational cost.
 1. The meaning of probability in PTSA (in Definition 4.3) is not well-defined and requires further clarification. This will be addressed in the Questions section below.

2. There are some errors in the proofs presented. This will be discussed in detail in the Questions section as well.
 1. Why does $v_0.pruning$ do in line 17 in Algorithm 1? Any difference from $S_L.delete(b_j)$. 

2. What role does the probability $\mathbb{P}$ in Definition 4.3 play in Algorithm 1?And, how to calculate $\phi$ in line 15 in Algorithm 1? In other words, when does $\phi(b_i)=\phi(b_s)$ hold true? Are both related? 

3. In your paper, you mentioned a previous work titled ""Monte Carlo Tree Search with Iteratively Refining State Abstractions."" That method directly calculates the distance between states and performs aggregation if the distance, denoted as $d(s_1, s_2)$, is below a threshold. This approach differs from the method proposed in your paper, but both aim to reduce the branching factor of MCTS. Have you conducted any experiments comparing your method with the approach mentioned above? I couldn't find any analysis of that method in Table 1 or the experimental section below. Some insight into the reason for this omission should be provided. 

4. This paper mentioned “reduce the computation time” with abstraction. My question (or curiosity) is how much overhead the checking operations (in Lines 14 and 15) incur. Note that in line 207 there is a time complexity which is required to be described in more detail, like $\log N_s$. 

5. Equation (19) in the appendix is written incorrectly. Need to be fixed. For example, the final $p_{bM}(b_2, b_3)$ should be $p_{bM}(b_1, b_3)$. Also fix some other wrong indices in (19).

The proposed PTSA algorithm can reduce the branching factor of MCTS and improve the computational efficiency of MCTS-based algorithms. The authors also provide both theoretical and empirical analyses. * The author claims that the proposed method can reduce the branching factor by 10% up to 45%. However, the result is based on only five Atari games. Based on Figure 3, the aggregation percentage varies across different Atari games. Can these five games represent all Atari-57 games? It would be more convincing to run more Atari games to support the claims.

* Moreover, it is unclear for the aggregation percentage on control tasks and Gomoku experiments. Without these experiments, it is inappropriate to claim “reduce branching factor by 10% up to 45%”.

* The time complexity of the proposed approach is higher than the original MCTS. It is unclear whether PTSAZero will still improve its efficiency when running under a larger simulation number. Currently, the authors only run “PTSAZero N=18” in Atari experiments. Will “PTSAZero N=30” perform better than “PTSAZero N=18”?

* Besides, in the board games such as Gomoku or Go, it is common to run large simulation numbers such as N=400 or N=800 during evaluation. It would be better to provide additional experiments/analyses to demonstrate the scale-up ability for PTSAZero. For example, providing the aggregation percentage/time usage/strength when using different simulation numbers. * In Algorithm 1, line 15, if $b_i$ and $b_s$ have different lengths, will their $\phi_{Q_{\alpha}^{psi}}(b)$ be different? In addition, what is the definition for $\phi_{Q_{\alpha}^{psi}}(b)$? Definition 4.3 only shows the probability. 
* In Algorithm 1, line 17, $v_0$ is root node and $b_j$ is a selection path. what does $v_0$.prunning($b_j$) mean?
* In Figure 2, will PTSA get better performance when using a larger simulation (N=30)? Current experiments only used N=18. It would be better to add another experiment with a larger simulation to show the scale-up ability of PTSA.
* In the Gomoku experiment, what does the expert opponent stand for? How many simulations are used in the Gomoku evaluation? As Gomoku is a two-player game, why not compare PTSAZero to other methods directly?
* line 302: “The winning rates of different methods w.r.t. training time are shown in Figure 4”. Should the range of the win rate be between 0 and 1 in Figure 4?
* In Figure 3, it seems that the aggregation percentage varies across different Atari games. Which type of game may have a higher aggregation percentage? Why do you choose these games? Can these five games represent Atari-57 games? Do you have more experiments on other Atari games?
* In Atari experiments, “As Gumbel MuZero does not require large simulations for Atari and control tasks”.

UPDATE: I thank the authors for their detailed response. After reading the other reviews and comments, I'm more inclined to recommend acceptance and have updated my score to reflect that. + The paper tackles an important problem of accelerating MCTS search. It does so using tree state abstraction. The approach is intuitively clear and is also supported by analysis. 

+ The paper proposes a novel tree state abstraction function based on path transitivity. The abstraction function is based on the difference in the Q values of the nodes (converted to probabilities) in the path. Although important implementation details are not clear to me, the intuition that abstracting entire paths accelerates search makes sense as does the abstraction of only the most recent path during search leading to smaller trees during online search. The paper is accompanied by analysis showing the correctness of the approach and an error bound under certain conditions. Overall, the algorithm seems to have high novelty.

+ The experiments are conducted on a number of Atari and Gym environments. Sampled MuZero with the proposed abstraction (PTSA) outperforms a number of strong baselines by a significant margin. The implementation seems to work very well. This seems to be a new state of the art in state abstraction for modern MCTS variants. - The approach is intuitively clear and seems to perform well empirically, which increases confidence. However, I found the description of the implementation details of Algorithm 1 difficult to follow. Please consider including a more careful description of the implementation in Section 4. The issue is exacerbated by the absence of code. This is currently preventing me from giving the paper a higher score.
  - For example, the actual implementation of the algorithm in L15 of Algorithm 1 is unclear to me. I expect it to involve Eq 5 with some value of $\alpha$ like 0.7. But Eq 5 returns a real-valued prob estimate for a path pair (b_i, b_s). How is that turned into a boolean value (True / False) in L15? It's probably not real-valued equality. This is a key detail so please explain.
  - There are a number of other implementation details that are difficult to find or missing. See the questions for examples.

- Given that the primary contribution is algorithmic and empirical, I'd have hoped to see the source code included. Reproducibility is going to be challenging without it and since this paper seems to establish a new state of the art, I'd encourage the authors to release their code. - I had a number of questions about the exact implementation
  - What exactly is the implementation of the branching condition of L15 of Algorithm 1? How does it relate to Eq 5 and 6 which is defined as a function taking two inputs (b_i, b_j) and returning a probability?
  - What exactly is learned during offline learning vs online search? $d, v, p$ are likely learned offline. What about the abstraction function $\phi$? This seems online to me. Correct?
  - What is $l$ set to in the implementation? How does it value impact performance?
  - What is the implementation of the pruning function in L17 of Algorithm 1?
  - How are the legal actions for the abstracted state computed?
  - What is the size of $S_L$? How was it chosen? How does varying it affect performance?

- As described in L346-349, there seem to be a number of choices for the designer to make. These are not clear to me at the moment besides the obvious ones (e.g., $\alpha, N$). Please enumerate what exactly needs to be hand-designed or set manually for a given domain and what can be used off-the-shelf.

 1. The method provides some theoretical guarantee.
2. The experiments take place in many environments.
3. The ablation studies have tried many abstraction functions. 
 1. The intuition of the paper is weird.  The method required of all states on the paths needs to be similar. However, there are two problems here. First, the V value might be more incorrect at the beginning. Second, even if the V value is correct for the whole path, this method reduces the chance of pruning more nodes. For example, in Atari, agents can reach the exact same state with different paths. Since the environment is MDP, we should merge those two states. 
 
2. It is unknown for the performance when the simulation is higher. The abstract error normally increases when the simulation increase. The method might delete some good paths that can only be identified after numerous simulations.


 1. How do you prune a path from a tree? What will happen to those branches that are on the path?
2. Have you considered abstraction functions that also require the best action should be the same\[1\]?

We can create an abstraction of the state space for MCTS by considering an abstraction over entire paths in the tree - two paths of equal length, that start from the same node in the tree, can be aggregated into a single abstract state, thus reducing the search space. The paper proposes to use a probabilistic approach to the abstraction process, using the justification that this enables the algorithm to recover from aggregation errors that it commits early on. The specific probabilistic approach discussed relies on a divergence measure between the distribution of the value functions across the entire two paths, thus merging together with high probability actions that lead to similar distributions of the value function. This abstraction helps mitigate the worst weakness of MCTS - it reduces the large search space. Some theoretical guarantees are provided, as well as several experimental results for different game problems and for control tasks.  The paper deals with the very important challenge of improving MCTS techniques. This type of research is applicable in many domains, as this is a well known and well used algorithm. 

The experimental results looks extensive and well-presented, and are the main strength of the paper. I especially liked the comparison of different state abstraction functions, as it showcases the contribution of the paper in coming up with a specific one that seems to work well. Adding a successful novel approach to a well established algorithm is not a trivial task, and experimental results seem very promising. This seems like a strong enough reason to publish on its own.  I thought the main weakness of the paper is its readability. I had a tough time understanding the approach and the logic behind it, even though I have some experience with MCTS specifically (though admittedly, it had been awhile). Some more careful attention can be given to notation and explanations. The math in this paper requires close scrutiny and some of the explanations seem to assume a close familiarity with the specifics of MCTS, as well as state abstraction functions. This results in a reduced reading experience and lower comprehension. 
Some examples: 
1. In equation (1) Q is never explicitly defined, figure 1 appears much earlier in the paper than the definition of the probability state abstraction 
2. The complex distinction between paths, states and nodes is not explicitly stated, and sometimes ignored - table 1 is referenced during the general RL discussion that has a state notation (s1, s2) but uses a different notation, that is later used for nodes (v1, v2). 
3. Some of the notation within Algorithm 1 is never explained (e.g., actions like pruning/delete/add and the usage of a hidden state h). 
4. Q* usage is never explained 
5. In the explanation after definition 4.3 - encourages nodes that have the same candidate actions with similar value distribution expectations to be aggregated - should that be be encourages paths ? The entire definition seems to be about aggregating paths instead of specific states, but paths that start from the same node. 

It is fine to delegate some details to referenced works, but a paper should at least succinctly explain its own notations and be as self-contained as possible. I trust these weaknesses in explanations and paper organization can be fixed by the authors.  1. Are you planning to publish the code you used? 
2. Please check your math for some typos - eq. 19 in appendix A.
 Some limitations are briefly addressed, namely the need for hyper-parameter tuning and manually selecting the underlying abstraction function.

1. The low efficiency of the LonvConv-based model during inference.
2. Whether it is advantageous to perform independent long convolutions on each channel or reduce the total number of filters without loss in quality.

To tackle problem (1), the authors propose distilling the LonvConv into a Diagonal State space model and train it using the $\ell_2$ loss function.

For problem (2), the authors suggest sharing long convolution coefficients across multiple channels, resulting in the MultiHyena structure.

The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated on multiple datasets. Distilling LonvConv into a Diagonal State space model is indeed a novel and meaningful approach. The conclusion of sharing long convolution coefficients across multiple channels is also innovative. I think the main issue with this article lies in the focus of the writing. From Equation 3.4, it is clear that the ultimate goal is to represent the LonvConv coefficients using a Diagonal State Space Model. However, a significant portion of the article is spent describing unrelated aspects. The most crucial part, determining the hidden dimension of the State Space Model, is merely brushed over, even though it is the key factor that affects the quality of the distillation and the efficiency of the final inference. On the other hand, the motivation behind the design of MultiHyena should be addressed in the main text since it is of utmost importance. 1. The method for determining the hidden dimension of the State Space Model needs to be explained in more detail. I referred to Appendix E.3.2, and I'm wondering if the core idea is to perform an SVD decomposition and then select the dimension for dimensionality reduction based on the eigenvalues?

2. The solution to Equation 3.4 requires a more detailed algorithm description or pseudocode to help readers follow along. I attempted to replicate it following Appendix B.1, but the results were not quite good. Could you provide the training configurations and an estimate of the training time?

3. The motivation behind the design of MultiHyena should be included in the main text, and ablation studies (sharing coefficients vs not sharing coefficients) should be conducted to validate the design's rationale. The experiments should compare the effects and speeds.

4. Does MultiHyena utilize the Local conv + Global conv structure of Hyena? If so, how many layers are used? This should be mentioned in the experiments.

5. Is the Algorithm 1 on page 28 is the implementation of Figure 4.1?

6. Regarding the implementation of MultiHyena, in Algorithm 1 on page 28, for $z^m_t \in \mathbb R^{L\times N\times N}$, what does the subscript $t$ represent? On the other hand, is the shape of $T_h$ $L$ (all features share one set of convolution coefficients) or $L\times N\times N$ (each feature has independent convolution coefficients)?

7. Continuing with the implementation of MultiHyena, in Algorithm 1 on page 28, is the shape of $T_hz^m_t$ ${L\times N\times N}$? If so, does $T_h(z^m_t)  q_t^m$ mean performing matrix multiplication between $\[T_h(z^m_t)\]_i \in \mathbb R^{N\times N}$ (for $i=0,\ldots,L-1$) and $q_t^m\in \mathbb R^{N}$, resulting in an output of shape $\mathbb R^{N}$? If not, what is the computation like?

8. The algorithm's output is $\bar{y} \leftarrow\left(\sum_m\right) y^m / M\in \mathbb R^{L\times N}$, while the input has a shape of $L\times D$. Is this inconsistency problematic, or did the algorithm omit something?

9. Algorithm 1 has several ambiguities. It is suggested to reorganize it for better clarity.

A key limitation of recently proposed convolutional models is that they use convolutional filters that extend potentially infinitely into the past, and the same techniques that yield efficient training do not transfer over to token-by-token generation. This paper proposes a post-training and data-free distillation step that replaces such convolutional models with a recurrent approach that uses constant time and memory at each step of generation during inference. The key strength of the paper is that proposes a novel and theoretically grounded distillation method, which achieves good approximation bounds without being tied to specific data or involving what amounts to an additional round of training.

Also, convolutional and state space models as a whole are an underexplored area in recent work when compared to Transformers and attention, and this paper puts forward a novel method of linking the two, both of which contribute to the originality of the paper. My biggest reservation based on my understanding of the paper is that I didn't get a qualitative sense of what might be lost as part of the distillation process. Is there some intuition of what is the worst-case qualitative behavior of a convolutional filter that can't be tightly approximated with LaughingHyena?

This question comes to mind because in the world of Transformers, it is no secret that most of the computational power spent on quadractic attention goes to waste. Just a small subset of the efficiency work there includes pruning entire heads, limiting each head to a head-specific attention context window, or even doing sliding-window attention with a fixed context length for the entire model. More in line with the present paper, work like Performer has developed an approximation for converting attention-based models into recurrent models -- at a cost. Notwithstanding the theory of the tightness of that last approximation, and equivalent performance of many to the Transformer that is demonstrated in some of the papers introducing these methods, there inevitably arises some situation where none of the approximations match the Transformer in quality. I worry that the present approach might fall into a similar pattern. A recurring theme in this area is that any method that sacrifices the ability to have long context, or to perform associative recall, is suspect. That's why when it comes to these approximations of convolutions, it would helpful to know whether the approximation is effectively some form of context-truncation in disguise, and if not what the qualitative cost is. How well does the LaughingHyena architecture perform on the associative recall task, especially as compared to Hyena (or MultiHyena)? Is the point beyond which the models fail to perform the task (in terms of sequence length or vocabulary size) different between the two?

For LM-Eval-Harness and HELM, have you tried a baseline of taking the impulse response from Hyena/MultiHyena and truncating it to a finite impulse response? A sliding window seems like one of the simplest approximations to try in the world of convolutions, and it would be helpful to know if maybe some defect of the tasks or the base model results in nothing more being required. This would, in fact, be a useful baseline to have in the paper.

The key assumption regarding the oblivious noise is that it assumes a value of $0$ with a probability within the range of $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$, which can be interpreted as the fraction of inliers. Notably, when $\alpha \leq 1/2$, it is proven to be information-theoretically impossible to find an approximate stationary point of the function. To address this challenge, the authors incorporate the concept of list-decoding into the framework of stochastic optimization, and focus instead on identifying a list of points where at least one of them is an approximate stationary point.

Technically, this paper presents an equivalence between list-decodable stochastic optimization with oblivious noise and list-decodable mean estimation problem leveraging a technique known as noisy location estimation. The analysis of list-decodable stochastic optimization with oblivious noise is conducted by examining the list-decodable mean estimation problem. This paper investigates an important setting of stochastic optimization introduces a fresh perspective by introducing the concept of list-decodable stochastic optimization. The definition of this new framework is not only intuitive and well-motivated by practical problems but also exhibits elegance from a theoretical standpoint, given how weak the assumptions on the noise model are. The algorithms presented in the paper, along with their corresponding proofs, are intricate and highly nontrivial from a technical standpoint. Nevertheless, the authors have succeeded in presenting the analyses in a well-organized manner, ensuring that they are generally not hard to follow. 1. As pointed out in the paper, an exponential dependence on $1/\eta$ is necessary in the list-size, which can mildly impact the overall appeal of the results. This dependency may introduce some considerations regarding scalability and practicality.

2. The framework presented in this paper is inherently abstract, and there is a lack of clarity concerning the algorithm's performance in concrete examples, including scenarios with more specific theoretical settings that incorporate additional assumptions, as well as practical problem domains. Correspondingly, I have the following questions that could possibly make the results even stronger if addressed:
1. Can the exponential dependence on $\eta$ be mitigated by making slight adjustments to the original definition of list-decodable stochastic optimization? For instance, are there additional assumptions that can be incorporated or specific parameter regimes that can be adjusted to reduce this exponential dependency?

2. Are there more concrete applications of list-decodable stochastic optimization methods?

The considered noise model includes two components: A bounded-variance observation noise (which is the typical well-studied type of noise), and oblivious outliers noise $\xi$ satisfying $Pr\[\xi = 0\] >= \alpha$. Furthermore, the distribution of the oblivious noise \xi does not need to be symmetric.

It is shown that if the fraction of inliers is below 1/2, it is information-theoretically impossible to give a unique solution. This is why the authors consider a list-decodable learner where the learner returns a list of solutions, one of which is guaranteed to be good. The authors show that if the fraction of inliers is sufficiently close to 1, then the algorithm can recover a single solution. Designing learning algorithms which are robust against adversarial or semi-adversarial type of noise is very important. The setup that is considered in this paper is original (as far as I can tell). I found the paper to be generally not very well written. The notation is a bit confusing in several places (e.g., check the question regarding line 203 below), and the writing style can be sometimes too informal.

One thing that I found crucially missing is the clear and formal statement of the problem and the clear statements of the assumptions. For example, what are the properties of the function $f(\gamma,x)$? The only property that I found is that $f(x) = E_{\gamma}\[f(\gamma,x)\]$ must be $L$-smooth. However, this is clearly not enough to even guarantee the existence of a stationary point. For example, consider $x\in \mathbb{R}$ (i.e., one dimension) and define $f(\gamma,x) = x$. In this case, we have $f(x) = x$ and hence $\nabla f(x) = 1$ fo all $x$ and there is no stationary point.

Here, one receives noisy gradients of a non-convex function $f(x) = \mathbb{E} \[f(x, \gamma)\]$ (where $\gamma$ is bounded variance observational noise) and the noisy gradient samples are generated as follows $\nabla_x f(x, \gamma) + \xi$ where $\xi$ is generated independently of $\gamma$ and $x$ with the only restriction that $\mathbb{P} (\xi = 0) \geq \alpha$. The paper specifically focuses on the setting where $\alpha \ll 1 / 2$. Under such mild restrictions on $\xi$, it is impossible to recover a single point which is guaranteed to be near-stationary. However, in line with recent results on list-decodable robust estimation, the paper shows that one can recover a list of estimates one of which is approximately stationary. 

Technically, the paper builds on two recent results on robust estimation. The first is SEVER which is a robust stochastic estimation algorithm focusing on the setting when $\alpha \to 1$. In this setting, it is possible to leverage recent robust estimation algorithms to clean the observed gradients and recover a good approximation to the true gradient (up to the degree determined by $1 - \alpha$) and then utilize this approximate gradient to find a stationary point. The second is a recent line of work on list-decodable mean estimation. Here, one receives corrupted samples from a high-dimensional distribution where $\alpha$ fraction of points are from the true distribution and the goal is to estimate its mean. While producing a single estimate is impossible, these algorithms return a list of size $1 / \alpha$, one of which is guaranteed to be accurate. In this paper, the authors essentially extend the SEVER framework to the list-decodable setting. However, this requires some novel technical contributions. A naive implementation would lead to exponential growth in the number of estimates (a list of size $l$ would have $l / \alpha$ many elements in the next iteration if each of its elements were queried and updated with the $1 / \alpha$ resulting gradients). Instead the authors introduce a novel technical tool that they term location estimation which when given samples from $z + \xi$ and $z' + t + \xi$ for some unknown $t$ (and $z$ and $z'$ have bounded covariance) can estimate $t$. With this tool, the algorithm starts by first generating $1/\alpha$ gradients at $0$ and initializing $1 / \alpha$ candidates each corresponding to one of the estimates. Then, each element of the list, $x$, is queried to produce gradient estimates. The location estimate procedure is then run on gradient estimates from $x$ and $0$ to essentially estimate $\nabla f(x) - \nabla f(0)$. Finally, from this each candidate is updated by estimating $\nabla f(x)$ using the particular estimate of $\nabla f(0)$ it corresponds to.

Overall, this is a really nice paper studying an interesting problem. My one concern is in the assumptions made in the paper. For instance, the assumptions don't capture the canonical estimation problem of list-decodable mean estimation. Here, one assumes that the true distribution has covariance bounded in spectral norm whereas this paper essentially assumes a bound on the expected squared length of a data point which could be larger by a factor of $d$. It would be interesting to see if these results could be extended to setting with weaker assumptions. Can we obtain similar results with $\mathbb{E} \[(\nabla f(x, \gamma) - \nabla f(x)) (\nabla f(x, \gamma) - \nabla f(x))^\top\] \prec \sigma^2 I$ as opposed to the stronger assumption in this paper of $\mathbb{E} \[\|\nabla f(x, \gamma) - \nabla f(x)\|^2\] \prec \sigma^2$ used here.

Because this problem is intractable in general, one needs to make plausible assumptions on the noise, that are realistic on one hand but allow for efficient analysis.

The noise model proposed here allows for noise to be unbounded, and introduces two simple constraints:

1. The unbounded noise when computing a gradient is *oblivious* in the following sense: there are two noise components, one that is well-behaved (zero mean and bounded variation), and one that is unbounded but oblivious/indpendent of both the location in which gradient is computed and the value of the well-behaved part of the noise.</li>

2. We assume the unbounded noise has probability bounded away from 0 to be equal to zero (i.e., to not exist at all).

It turns out that these two relatively weak conditions allow for efficient robust first order optimization. Specifically, these conditions allow for list-decodable robust optimization, where the goal is to output a list of candidate outputs where at least one should be a good approximation of the correct optimization outcome. The main technical result shows how to solve this problem by reducing it to list-decodable mean estimation, a problem that enjoyed substantial progress in recent years. The authors also show a reduction in the opposite direction. A substantial component in the technical analysis is a procedure that the authors develop for location estimation in an appropriate noisy setting. 1. Interesting and important goal, of better understanding the beyond worst case landscape for (first order) optimization.

2. Writing is very clear and relatively easy to follow for me (a non-expert outsider). 

3. The assumptions required for the analysis are weak and seemingly realistic. 1. The technical novelty is perhaps somewhat limited, the work relies heavily on reductions to existing results in robust mean estimation.

This noise might not have bounded moments and isn't necessarily centered. The authors propose a Noisy Location Estimation approach that estimates the gradient difference between two points, specifically \nabla f(x_t)-\nabla f(x_0). As such, they maintain robust estimations of the gradient at all points {x_t} as long as there is a reliable estimation of \nabla f(x_0). The new setup for oblivious noise introduced in the work is plausible, and the authors effectively discuss its relation to existing research. The Noisy Location Estimation proposed by the authors provides an innovative way to estimate gradient differences accurately, reducing the stochastic optimization problem to a mean estimation problem, which seems simpler in the setting. Also, as shown by the authors, the reverse of the reduction holds by simple arguments. The paper's presentation, particularly in the technical sections, lacks clarity.

1. Definitions should be more precise and self-contained. For instance, the work seems to require that oblivious noise be independent of the noisy gradient, but Definition 1.1 doesn't explicitly state this. In Definition 1.3, phrases like ""sufficiently small constant"" are too vague.
2. The methodology for mean estimation (Fact 2.1), isn't discussed in the main body. A brief discussion may be helpful.
3. The ""Rejection Sampling"" discussion on page 5 is difficult to follow and potentially misleading. From my understanding, the core intuition is to identify a large enough domain of size $i$, such that $i$ times the conditional expectation is robust and stable upon shifting the domain. 1. In Line 227, it appears that \[i- 4 · 12, i + 4 · 12) almost fully contains \[i - 4 · 12, -i + 4 · 12)\]. If that's the case, why is there a need for a \cup operation?
2. In Section 5, why is the exponential dependence on 1/\eta for the size of the list unavoidable?
3. Is it a requirement for the Noisy Location Estimation that alpha > 0? I didn't delve into the proof details, but it seems that if you're considering the conditional expectation, it might not require alpha > 0. Can you clarify this?

70,Sabine-Pahl,Environmental volunteer well-being: Managers’ perception and actual well-being of volunteers,"Background: Environmental volunteering can increase well-being, but environmental volunteer well-being has rarely been compared to participant well-being associated with other types of volunteering or nature-based activities. This paper aims to use a multidimensional approach to well-being to explore the immediately experienced and later remembered well-being of environmental volunteers and to compare this to the increased well-being of participants in other types of nature-based activities and volunteering. Furthermore, it aims to compare volunteer managers’ perceptions of their volunteers’ well-being with the self-reported well-being of the volunteers. Methods: Onsite surveys were conducted of practical conservation and biodiversity monitoring volunteers, as well as their control groups (walkers and fieldwork students, respectively), to measure general well-being before their nature-based activity and activity-related well-being immediately after their activity. Online surveys of current, former and potential volunteers and volunteer managers measured remembered volunteering-related well-being and managers’ perceptions of their volunteers’ well-being. Data were analysed based on Seligman’s multidimensional PERMA (‘positive emotion’, ‘engagement’, ‘positive relationship’, ‘meaning’, ‘achievement’) model of well-being. Factor analysis recovered three of the five PERMA elements, ‘engagement’, ‘relationship’ and ‘meaning’, as well as ‘negative emotion’ and ‘health’ as factors. Results: Environmental volunteering significantly improved positive elements and significantly decreased negative elements of participants’ immediate well-being, and it did so more than walking or student fieldwork. Even remembering their volunteering up to six months later, volunteers rated their volunteering-related well-being higher than volunteers rated their well-being generally in life. However, volunteering was not found to have an effect on overall mean well-being generally in life. Volunteer managers did not perceive the significant increase in well-being that volunteers reported. Conclusions: This study showed how environmental volunteering immediately improved participants’ well-being, even more than other nature-based activities. It highlights the benefit of regarding well-being as a multidimensional construct to more systematically understand, support and enhance volunteer well-being.","Approved  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.  Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  Title and Abstract: This is fine. I have some comments on the comparisons and causality below that the authors should consider.  Article content/ Conclusions: The article is well written and overall clearly structured. Using the PERMA model is a good addition. The specific research questions are very helpful in communicating the research. Nevertheless I have picked up two issues that are worth considering, and a few minor comments.  I wasn’t entirely convinced by the research question looking at managers’ perception of volunteer well-being. Why is it important that these correspond (p. 3)? Even if it is important, as far as I understand, the comparison is not straightforward. The volunteers rated by the managers are not the same people as rate their own well-being, are they? So the conclusion of non-correspondence is problematic, if you’re comparing the rated/perceived well-being of *different* people.  My second issue is around the language/interpretation in the article, specifically in the Implications section. You seem to assume these are causal effects i.e. the volunteering causes people’s improved well-being (and therefore it should be used more widely). But it’s not quite that straightforward, as you haven’t allocated people to different activities so there might be other differences between people who walk vs. volunteer for example, that could account for any effects you find. You can only make strong inferences about causality when you use a proper experimental research design. It would be good to note this in the discussion. (I think only the Wyles et al. article has tried this in the volunteering literature). You mention also that choice is important, which is a related consideration. This is where recommendations are a bit tricky, because you can’t (by definition) force people to ‘volunteer’ even it is good for them, and there may be selection effects that mean happier / healthier people are also the ones who do environmental volunteering. This is not a big problem but I feel should be acknowledged.  Minor points: I think a lot of space is dedicated to the different factor analyses (on pages 7-11) to establish questionnaire structure. While this is important and good practice it is not linked to any of the main research questions. Therefore I was wondering if (some of) this should be presented in an Appendix rather than the main text, as it distracts from the key questions and findings.  On p. 18 literature on the amount of time spent volunteering is reviewed but this all seems to be published in gerontology journals so I’m assuming uses older samples.

The paper is concerned with the NetHack challenge, a complex AI challenge that in 2021 reached headlines, because symbolic agents considerably outperformed neural agents. I see three main contributions in the paper:
 - The construction of a large-scale dataset, based on the best symbolic agent and its policy choices, that can enable training better neural agents
 - The training of better neural agents based on this dataset, and other improvements
 - A systematic analysis of the effect of different technical improvements (hierarchical BC, larger Transformer models, larger datasets, online fine-tuning with RL), notably finding that scaling training sets or model size alone will not bridge the gap to the best symbolic agent.

The problem is of very high interest to the AI community, and the technical investigation, results, and discussion appear thorough and insightful. The dataset might also enable further research. I find especially the results regarding scaling interesting, i.e., that performance increases logarithmic, and so more data or bigger models alone will not enable achieving parity with the symbolic approach.

Quality of writing is very good, and so the paper is easy to follow (subject to my lack of technical background).

Minor notes:
 - The paper appears to be missing a link to the dataset
 - The related work is not easy to access for someone not close to the field. E.g., paragraphs on ""imitation learning"" and ""hierarchical policy learning"" give too little detail about the basic ideas (do not start with descriptions of what they are for, but what they do)
 - ""The full observation space of NLE is far richer and more informed than the view afforded to human players of NetHack, who observe only the more ambiguous “text-based” components of NLE observations"" - I do not fully understand this sentence, please expand. What can systems observe in NLE, that humans don't receive in the original interface? Or do you mean that NLE aggregates the Ascii terminal characters into something more high-level?
 - Showing an excerpt from the dataset would be helpful, especially, as it is not quite clear what is added there, both strategies and substrategies? Or the more specific one only?

Symbolic agents use hierarchical policies and parsers to extract high-level features
Symbolic agents have handcrafted heuristics and error correction
Neural agents lack inductive biases like hierarchy that may be needed for sparse rewards
Experiments show hierarchy, scale, and combining imitation and RL help improve neural agents:
Hierarchical behavior cloning improves over flat BC
Larger Transformer-based architectures improve over LSTMs
RL fine-tuning provides gains, especially for underfitting models
But significant gaps to symbolic agents remain The experimental design is very clever, the chart is very clear, and the experimental effect is obvious. The paper explores a novel problem domain of applying neural networks to master the game NetHack, where current methods struggle compared to symbolic AI. The authors introduce a new large-scale dataset of NetHack demonstrations called HiHack to facilitate this analysis. The idea of using demonstrations to help neural networks learn better policies in sparse, long-horizon environments like NetHack is creative.The methods are detailed appropriately to replicate experiments. Results are presented logically and incorporate useful visualizations. The conclusion summarizes takeaways concisely.Mastering complex environments like NetHack with sparse rewards and long time horizons remains an open challenge for deep RL. This paper provides significant evidence and analysis characterizing the limitations of current neural network methods in these settings, and points the way towards progress, whether via incorporating stronger inductive biases like hierarchy or combining neural and symbolic approaches. The insights will broadly impact research in sparse reward RL, imitation learning, and integrating neural and classical AI. This model is based on the nethack, and the results hold up on the above models, and whether the above results can still hold up on the other models。The authors recognize the limited generality so far of methods tested on NetHack to other complex environments.No obvious harmful biases or problematic data sources are introduced in this work. The NetHack environment itself seems relatively innocuous.

I have one comment: - Page 14 ""Regarding the NLF dataset, a common problem is related with the property rdf:langString used for language-tagged string values that are validated against xsd:string"" - In such cases, why did you constrain the property value's datatype to ""xsd:string"" - instead of ""LITERAL"" (https://shex.io/shex-semantics/index.html#shexc) in the ShEx definition? For example, concerning NLF dataset's class Person, you have constrained the property schema:name's value to xsd:string (https://github.com/hibernator11/ShEx-DLs/blob/1.1/nlf/nlf-person.shex#L12). In the NLF data model the range of schema:name is defined as ""Literal"" (https://www.kiwi.fi/display/Datacatalog/Fennica+RDF+data+model), and in the schema.org vocabulary the range of schema:name is defined loosely: ""schema:name schema:rangeIncludes schema:Text"" (https://schema.org/version/latest/schemaorg-current-https.ttl).

3,Katherine-Thornton,A Shape Expression approach for assessing the quality of Linked Open Data in Libraries,"Cultural heritage institutions are exploring Semantic Web technologies to publish and enrich their catalogues. Several initiatives, such as Labs, are based on the creative and innovative reuse of the materials published by cultural heritage institutions. In this way, quality has become a crucial aspect to identify and reuse a dataset for research. In this article, we propose a methodology to create Shape Expressions definitions in order to validate LOD datasets published by libraries. The methodology was then applied to four use cases based on datasets published by relevant institutions. It intends to encourage institutions to use ShEx to validate LOD datasets as well as to promote the reuse of LOD, made openly available by libraries.\n","The paper A Shape Expression approach for assessing the quality of Linked Open Data in Libraries is a strong candidate for publication in the Special Issue Cultural Heritage 2021. I recommend that it is ready to be accepted for publication. The manuscript is original in that it is the first discussion of validating bibliographic data in RDF using ShEx. Many interactive examples are presented and readers can try out ShEx validation for themselves to more fully understand the points the authors make in the paper.  The importance of this paper is that it addresses a practical application of semantic web technologies to a real-life workflow issue of validation of bibliographic data in RDF. The usefulness of this paper is high in that the online validation examples are practical for others to consult and see in action. Data from several organizations can be validated using the pre-composed manifests and schemas. This will help readers understand the utility of creating quality assessment pipelines in additional contexts.  The relevance of this paper is very high because many libraries are interested in converting some of their bibliographic data to RDF and are looking for useful tooling.  The stability of the validation workflow depends on an external tool, the ShEx2 Simple Online Validator. This tool has been available on the web for several years, if it remains available then the example manifests and schemas will continue to be working examples. In my opinion many readers interested in the Special Issue on Cultural Heritage and the Semantic Web will find this paper valuable.",257,0,0,0.7855000000000001,0.2496247619,0.9288473129,87,32.83,0.1858,semanticweb,0.0,3,4,4,3,factual,3,3,70,polite,4,positive,4,low,3,5,4,3,factual,3,4,85,polite,5,positive,5,none,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,factual,5.0,5.0,90.0,polite,5.0,positive,4.0,none,1,4,3,1,factual,4,3,60,polite,5,positive,4,low,3,4,4,3,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,positive,3,low
11,Palwinder-Singh,"Anti-inflammatory activity and toxicity evaluation of 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea","Background: Inflammation is a normal protective response caused by an injury or tissue damage, through physical trauma, damaging chemicals, or invasion of pathogenic microorganisms. One of the modified p-aminophenol compounds is 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea, which was estimated to have more potent analgesic activity and fewer hepatotoxic side effects than paracetamol. When the lipophilicity of this compound increases between 1.8 to 4.4, it is observed to serve as an anti-inflammatory agent. Therefore, the determination of safety precaution is very necessary while testing for the toxicity effect of 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea. This is due to the effectiveness and safety of suitable drugs. Methods: An anti-inflammatory test was carried out by measuring the percentage of inflammation in rats, after the administration of 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea was previously induced by the carrageenan solution intraplantar and the analysis of neutrophil values through a plethysmometer and Hematoxylin-Eosin method. Also, an acute toxicity test was performed by administering this p-aminophenol compound to female rats for 24 h and observed for 14 days. In addition, a subchronic toxicity test was conducted on male and female rats for 28 days, with continuous observations carried out for 42 days. Results: The doses of 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea at 50, 100, and 200 mg/Kg BW, had anti-inflammatory activity compared to diclofenac sodium at 2.25 mg/Kg BW. Also, there is no toxicity and animal death symptoms were observed in the acute and subchronic tests. Conclusion: This 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea compound had an anti-inflammatory activity and relatively low toxicity.","Not Approved  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.  Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  This reviewer read the manuscript with interest and rather several times to see what new science has been explored. To my surprise the subject is the compound 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea. Some of the questions that arise are: Why did the authors choose this compound for the study?  What is the rationale for the selection of 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea?  Endless data has been recorded by the authors. What reference drug/compound was used? Diclofenac is a COX-1/2 non-selective NSAID. In the first paragraph of ‘Results’ section, it is not clear whether the urea derivative is more potent than diclofenac or not.  Is it not possible to calculate IC50 for this urea derivative against COX-1 and COX-2?  Since this compound has already been studied for its analgesic effect, are  the results of the present study comparable to those already reported?  What exactly is the mode of action of this urea derivative? Does it act through COX-2 inhibition or some other pathway?  What about the COX-1, COX-2 selectivity?  In the light of above mentioned issues, this reviewer is not in favour of indexing this manuscript until the objectives are clear.

155,Paul-Groth,Reengineering application architectures to expose data and logic for the web of data,"This paper presents a novel approach to reengineer legacy web applications into Linked Data applications, based on the knowledge of the architecture and source code of the applications. Existing application architectures can be provided with linked data extensions that work either at the model, view, and controller layer. Whereas black-box scraping and wrapping techniques are commonly used to add semantics to existing web applications without changing their source code, this paper presents a reverse engineering approach, which enables the controlled disclosure of the internal functions and data model as Linked Data. The approach has been implemented for different web development frameworks. The reengineering tool is compared with existing linked data engineering solutions in terms of software reliability, maintainability and complexity.","This paper describes an approach for reengineering Model View Controller (MVC) applications such that they expose Linked Data. The approach, named EasyData, focuses primarily on web applications. Summarizing the approach, the idea is to modify the Model of a typical web application (implemented typically by an Object-Relational Mapper) to also output data according to web vocabularies, to modify the View so that data is presented with RDFa / Microdata, and to modify the Controller such that the APIs are Linked Data compatible.  To help developers perform reengineering, two packages were developed for two popular web frameworks Ruby on Rails (EasyData_Rails) and Django (EasyData_Django). In terms of evaluation, the Rails package was applied to Redmine (redmine.org) an open source project management application. Secondly, software metrics were calculated for EasyData_Django and compared to 5 other software packages (e.g. Stanbol, D2Rq) that are also designed to help create Linked Data exposing applications.  First, I think this is an important problem to address. It’s not always straightforward to make applications Linked Data compatible and providing packages that focus on common development environments is a good one. The authors do a good job of defining the research methodology they are using from Oates. But I would have liked to see more details of what each of the steps actually required. Adding an additional paragraph describing what each of these steps require would be helpful.  There are two areas where the paper/tools need to be improved.  1) Evaluation I liked the approach of using a complex case study that’s open source, but the outcome of the application to redmine was not shown. What did the resulting project management software do? Figure 3 shows a service API but the namespace is published in example.org. It would be good to provide a place to download the updated version of the software and screenshots in the paper of what the results of the application of EasyData look like.  Again the authors provide a unique approach to evaluation with the application of software quality metrics. I really liked this approach. But it’s unclear why this validates the EasyData reengineering approach. This just says something about the EasyData software quality. While an interesting finding, the link is not made clear. Also, because EasyData Django is newer code one could argue that it will show less code complexity and code density than older software such as D2RQ.  What would have been of interest is a comparison of the software quality of software constructed using the multiple different approaches. Essentially, answering the question does the EasyData approach lead to better software than other existing approaches.  2) Software usability / evidence impact A key question for a Tools paper is the impact of the tool. Currently, no evidence is provided for large scale uptake. Another way to measure the potential of use is the quality of software itself. While the software metrics present give some indication of that, I think a key part of tool uptake is software usability this includes documentation. I would have liked to see a small tutorial at the GitHub repo which would have allowed someone to apply the approach to a small django app.  Overall, I think there is more work to be done in providing evidence for the tool and methodology’s applicability but there’s definitely something here.  Minor comments: - “Web of data” —> “Web of Data” - define LD at first use. - Look at combining footnotes 1 & 2 as footnote 2 relies on footnote 1’s definition. - You should provide a link to the redmine application website. - In the introduction, it is unclear the Linked Data (LD) principles that are being referred to.

The model, view or controller components of existing applications can be extended to publish linked data.  EasyData has been implemented for the popular Ruby on Rails and Django web application frameworks.  A comparison with other state-of-the-art linked data publishing platforms w.r.t. several software metrics shows that EasyData performs comparatively well. Let me first address the specific review criteria for a tool/system report: (1) Quality, importance, and impact of the described tool or system: Recency is also a quality criterion.  EasyData_Rails was last updated almost 5 years ago, EasyData_Django 3 years ago.  Other than README files and a few comments in the source code, I don't see much documentation.  Looking at the repositories, there are no signs of activity: few contributors, no issues, no forks (other than your own ones).  I don't see evidence that anyone has used EasyData, except yourself for adding linked data support to the Redmine project management tool.  Also, this extension of Redmine just seems to exist as an example within the scope of this article; I don't even see where it can be downloaded. (2) Clarity, illustration, and readability of the describing paper, which shall convey to the reader both the capabilities and the limitations of the tool: The paper itself is largely well-written.  Section 1 clearly states the importance of adding linked data support to web applications.  Section 2 gives a well-structured overview of existing reengineering approaches, with a focus on the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture.  One issue here is that MVC is rarely applied in a pure way.  Can you also address variants or partial implementations of MVC?  In Section 3, the capabilities of EasyData are presented clearly.  The evaluation by a proof-of-concept of adding linked data to Redmine, and by a comparison with other approaches, in Section 4 is comprehensible – but, and that's the weakest point of the paper, it could be a lot more convincing – that's basically what I require as ""major revision"".  Except for one minor observation, no lesson learned from Redmine is presented.  Also, I'm not convinced by Table 1.  Linking instances of a web app's data to linked data resources would have a much larger impact than linking the limited terminology of a software to DBpedia.  Regarding the comparative evaluation it is not sufficiently clear whether the competing linked data reengineering approaches are actually comparable to EasyData w.r.t. the chosen software metrics.  Competing tools might have a much broader functionality, and might thus have a larger code case while at the same time suffering from more vulnerabilities.  Any observations about EasyData should therefore be interpreted in relation to its small code base.

Through comprehensive evaluations, the RDGAN demonstrate that it outperforms vanilla DDGAN in terms of the aforementioned
generative modeling criteria, i.e., image quality, mode coverage of distribution, and inference speed, and exhibits improved robustness when dealing with both clean and corrupted datasets.

with outlier samples.
This article introduces a novel approach by employing a semi-unbalanced optimal transport to mitigate the impact of outliers effectively. The approach employed in the paper may appear to lack novelty. This is because the RDGAN simply replaces the loss function of diffusion GANs with a semi-unbalanced optimal transport, without conducting a thorough analysis of the relationship between the semi-unbalanced optimal transport and diffusion GANs from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. 1. I would suggest that the author conducting a thorough analysis of the relationship between the semi-unbalanced optimal transport and diffusion GANs from both empirical and theoretical perspectives in the corrupted with outlier samples.

2. In Tables 1 and 2, RDGAN still does not achieve the best results when compared to other methods.

3. I recommend that the author present a comparison of results for different diffusion step values (T) in DRGAN, DDGAN, and the ablation study.

4. I recommend that the author provide a explanation of why the semi-dual UOT objective
ensuring that the fast sampling time of DDGAN is preserved in RDGAN?

5. ""In contrast, DDGAN’s
FID increases by more than 10 points, and the synthesized outlier ratio of RDGAN rises from 0.2
to 3.8 compared to DDGAN’s increase from 3.2 to 9.8.""
Does this mean that DDGAN is more likely to synthesize more samples in outlier data compared to RDGAN? Is this considered a desirable capability, or is it potentially problematic?

The method was empirically evaluated on image generation. The strength of this paper is its technical soundness. The motivation is properly justified. The proposed method seems to make sense as a solution to the robustness problem to be solved. The main weakness of this paper is the novelty of the proposed method which seems to be a direct marriage of two existing ideas.  Indeed, this hasn't been done. However, I'm not sure how much this field of research will benefit from this obvious extension, especially when the practical side of this paper is also weak.  The experiments were done in very low dimensional settings, which is fine if the novelty of the approach is great.  When both are lacking, I'm reluctant to accept it to be published with the current version.  

**Minor**:  
The writing of the paper can be improved, including the organisation of the paper flow, as well as the typos such as a wrongly referenced equation (""equation 13"" in the paragraph before section 2.2),  the c-transform of v (following equation 6), and introducing ""Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT)"" twice.  

Some languages used need to be a bit more rigorous. For instance, in the paragraph 2 in the introduction - ""slow computational speed"" is confusing. The computational speed for training a diffusion model isn't slow in comparison.  It's only the inference/sampling speed that's the problem.  Second example is when you say ""Equation 13 can be reformulated as a **more** general optimal transport problem:"".  Obviously equation 13 is more general as D_{adv} can be one of the many distances/divergences.

Through comprehensive evaluations, this paper demonstrates that the proposed RDGAN outperforms vanilla DDGAN in terms of the FID and recall, meanwhile being robust to outliers. The robustness of diffusion generative models is an important topic but is relatively less studied in the literature. This paper presents a simple modification to the existing DDGAN method, by using the semi-unbalanced optimal transport, to improve the method's robustness to outliers.

Empirically, a suite of numerical results is presented to show the robust performance. The contribution of this paper is limited. This paper replaces the reverse KL divergence in vanilla DDGAN with the unbalanced optimal transport. However, there are not much insights stated in the paper for using UOT.

Moreover, the experiments seem to be insufficient as well, there is a lack of comparison with the type of methods such as Wasserstein GAN, OT-GAN (and UOT-GAN if possible). In addition, in terms of the robustness of the proposed method and the ablation studies, this paper only compares with the vanilla DDGAN method, which is a bit limited. Please see the above in the weakness section. My main questions are: (1) is there any insight for using UOT objective within the DDGAN framework, why would it improve the overall image quality and convergence speed (even under the scenarios without outliers), and (2) is it possible to also compare with OT-GAN type methods since they also use OT type divergence for discriminators.",254,0,0,0.771,-0.0308035714,0.9117639065,48,36.4682,0.2191,iclr,0.0,1,4,3,1,partially factual,3,4,60,neutral,3,neutral,4,low,5,5,4,5,partially factual,5,5,85,polite,5,neutral,5,none,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,partially factual,3.0,4.0,60.0,polite,4.0,neutral,4.0,low,3,4,3,3,factual,4,4,70,polite,4,neutral,4,low,3,4,3,4,partially factual,3,4,75,polite,5,neutral,4,low

The paper attempts to compare different storage models and approaches for RDF (linked) data like well-established and modern RBBMs, graph DBs, and triple-stores.  Although the proposed topic is indeed quite important (contrasting all these different storage models) is important and interesting and quite some engineering work has been conducted in collected data and evaluation various systems, in my opinion the paper does not succeed in providing sufficient fundamental or scientifically deep comparison or results.  On the one hand, the proposed benchmark is ill described. There are no details about the queries that have have been designed (how they have been designed, how large or complex they are, how many joins, etc.). A similar description is missing about the data model and complexity of the RDF dataset. Is the dataset highly interconnected or is it just small disconnected parts? On the other hand, with the massive number of RDF and SPARQL benchmarks out there and the evluations that have been conducted it is very difficult to justify why this is not just another collected dataset together with some queries and to show originality and novelty. Another key issue missing is a description about how the RDF data were converted and stored in the RDBMS and MongoDB. This is an important issue that needs a better description. It is especially important for MongoDB since key-value pairs are significantly weaker than triples. In the evaluation one should also present the number of tuples returned by each system. Perhaps I missed it but are they all returning the same number of answers for all queries. Comparing RDBMs systems with triple-stores is slightly unfair in the sense that the latter are also supposed to perform some kind of RDFS-reasoning either at loading or at query time (or at least they are supposed to be able to query interconnected graph-like data) hence it is not surprising that the RDBMs systems are faster. Especially if the dataset is quite loosly interconnected and the data can be easily mapped to the relational model then this is indeed the case. Overall it is not clear what are the results of this experiment. If one required some kind of RDFS reasoning then definatelly the RDBMs systems would be useless (even though faster) but if one does not need any kind of reasoning then obviously the RDBMs systems are the choice to go. It is not clear to which figures the observations in section 4 are referring to. Some conclusion is made but it is hard figure out out how and why this conclusion is produced. It would be good to add pointers, e.g., Fuseki did this (see Fig 4 (x)). Equation on page 6 should be clarified and made more precisely.

So, the main feature of this benchmark should be fairness and justice in order to facilitate the developers' selection of the most suitable technology. In order to achieve that goal, the benchmark should not favor any of the storage solution by wrongly chosen performance metric and selected queries that are not equivalent among storage solutions. As the benchmark is designed to evaluate relational DBMSs, No-SQL, and triple stores, so the queries have to be in different languages (SQL, SPARQL), but still equivalent in their semantic and complexity. This is not the case here, and will be explained in details. [Sec 1]: In the Introduction, there is a statement that there is no benchmark that combines 4 mentioned properties. Actually, there is: LDBC Social Network Benchmark. It test fundamental data operations, it is technology agnostic, evaluates relations DBMSes, No-SQL, triple stores, graph database systems, etc, and it operates on synthetic datasets, that mimic all real-world characteristics. [Sec 2.8]: If a computer has 16GB of RAM, it is not good idea to give all of them to the database system. In order to start Virtuoso server, it is necessary to have the virtuoso.ini file in the current directory. If that is not the case, and you start the server in foreground (just like author mentioned with +foreground option), it is not true that there is no error message. You will see: ""There is no configuration file virtuoso.ini"". Some of the parameters are used with '+', but some of them are supposed to be used with '-', e.g. (-f which is the same as +foreground). [Sec 3]: The performance metric doesn't make sense. I don't see the reason why the preparation time will affect performance score in the following equation: performance(database, queryscenario, testseries) = (prepare + execution1[+execution2 + execution3])/3. For example, in the RDBMS, in the preparation step we have creation of the indices, and there is no such use case scenario where we will drop index before execution of each query, and build it over and over again. Usually, these indices are build once, before or after loading the data, and these times should affect loading times, not query execution times. But, on the other side, the preparation phase for triple stores for almost all query scenarios does not exist, and all of these measurements for Fuseki and Virtuoso are almost 0. Building indices will take a lot of time (couple of seconds for MEDIUM test series). This is not fair and it is triple-store biased. This is the reason why author considered Virtuoso as ""the best aggregation performer"" in Section 4.5, and it is not true at all that ""Virtuoso already stores atomic field information instead of complete records"", as the author stated.  For example, in AGGREGATE_PUBLICATIONS_PER_PUBLISHER_ALL Test Series MEDIUM, the query execution times are: SQLite-Xerial 1112.13 ms PostgreSQL    1592.18 ms Virtuoso      3018.93 ms but in figure 4b you presented PostgreSQL as the best performer (1.0), followed by Virtuoso (1.11) and then by SQLite-Xerial (2.18). The reason for this is the preparation time. It is very similar in all the other query scenarios. For example, in AGGREGATE_PUBLICATIONS_PER_PUBLISHER_TOP10, Virtuoso was slightly faster than SQLite-Xerial, and for one order of magnitude faster than ArangoDB, but that cannot be seen from the performance metric: Virtuoso (1.0), SQLite-Xerial (3.63) and ArangoDB (7.05). [Sec 4]: A lot of observations from this section cannot be valid because of the wrongly chosen performance metric. [Sec 4.1]: Errors_Virtuoso_SMALL.txt: This is not a bug in Virtuoso, this is the configuration issue. You should increase max vector length setting in virtuoso.ini file. It is the same problem reported in Errors_Virtuoso_MEDIUM.txt. Virtuoso is well known because of its scalability, so the issue reported in Errors_Virtuoso_LARGE.txt stops it from competition on this scale factor. It would be better to fix the syntax of RDF file, and repeat the experiment than excluding Virtuoso from this part of game. [Sec 4.3]: In the entity retrieval query scenario, there are two main problems. The first one lies in the fact that the SQL queries executed against relational DBMSs are not equivalent to the SPARQL queries, while the second one is the use of DESCRIBE query statement, which is not strictly specified in the W3C specification. DESCRIBE may produce quite different results depending on describe-mode. I would not recommend using constructs that are not strictly defined by the standard. The author uses the following query: describe * where {   ?s ?p ?o .   ?s  ?identifier .   FILTER( ?identifier IN ( ##ids## )) } This is similar to: select ?s ?p ?o where {   {     ?s ?p ?o .     ?s  ?identifier .     FILTER( ?identifier IN ( ##ids## ))   }   UNION   {     ?s ?p ?o .     ?o  ?identifier .     FILTER( ?identifier IN ( ##ids## ))   } } which is much more complicated than the relational query: select * from justatable where dcterms_identifier in (?); So, this is unfair against triple stores, and favors relational DBMSs. The equivalent query should be: select ?s ?p ?o where {   ?s ?p ?o .   ?s  ?identifier .   FILTER( ?identifier IN ( ""011363517"" )) } All of these queries will be executed by Virtuoso (on my computer which has similar power to the used one, same configurations, Test Series MEDIUM) in 1-2ms, while the author's proposed SELECT statement in Listing 1, will take about 7s. So, this is very unfair to Virtuoso. In this query scenario, the ordering is not mentioned anywhere, so the Virtuoso's bug referenced in [9] doesn't affect this query at all. [Sec 4.4]: In the Conditional Table Scan scenario, the relational DBMSs are favored at the same way as in the previous section. The needed query should be: select ?s ?p ?o where {   ?s   .   ?s ?p ?o } instead of: describe * where { 	?s ?o ?p . 	optional { ?s  ?type . } 	?s   . } The first query will run by Virtuoso in 300s (on my computer, as explained before), which is comparable to the relational systems. The second conditional query should be: select ?s ?p ?o where {   ?s  ?title .   filter regex(?title, 'stud(ie|y)', 'i') .   ?s ?p ?o. } which will run much faster than the query executed against Virtuoso. Queries executed against Fuseki, are not correct either. The pattern: optional { ?s  ?type . } is not needed at all, while the pattern optional { ?s  ?title . } should not be optional, as there is the following filter: filter regex(?title, 'stud(ie|y)', 'i') . Similar remarks stay in the 3rd conditional query. [Sec 4.5]: In the Aggregation section, queries are comparable, but the conclusions are not (see remarks about performance metric) [Sec 5]: Because all of the aforementioned remarks, this section is quite wrong. The author said that Virtuoso was well in the certain deletion scenarios, e.g. DELETE_LOW_SELECTIVITY_PAPER_MEDIUM - Test Series MEDIUM, but the reason for that lies in the fact that UPDATE_LOW_SELECTIVITY_PAPER_MEDIUM finished with an error, and there was no triple that should be deleted in this scenario.

5,Alison-Kutywayo,A systematic review: Male engagement in adolescent and young adults’ sexual and reproductive health in the Americas,"Progress towards sexual and reproductive health (SRH) goals for adolescents across the Americas has stagnated. Of all the regions worldwide, Latin America has experienced the slowest decline in adolescent fertility rates. Reports published by the United Nations and multiple nongovernmental organizations demonstrate a growing consensus for a masculinities framework that engages men and boys in public health and social change. Male engagement acts as a complement - and not a replacement - of current SRH. Emerging evidence indicates that Coronavirus disease in 2019  has worsened SRH outcomes, especially related to gender-based violence; new evidence-based interventions are ever more urgent.  This systematic review includes a focus on education-based male engagement, a special consideration of gender equity, and systematic searches by fluent speakers in three most populous languages in the Americas (English, Spanish, and Portuguese). PubMed, EBSCO, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar databases were digitally searched. Publications were excluded if their focus did not align directly with sexual reproductive health, their location was outside the scope of study, its content derived from information collected before 2010, or its study’s population’s age of focus was not between 15-24 years of age. After abstract screening and full-text review, the original 10,721 articles identified were narrowed down to 13 articles whose references were further examined through hand searching, leading us to a total of 32 final articles chosen for analysis. The results were classified by geographic regions of the American continent. The literature emphasized that society often defines masculinity as a hegemonic role grounded in aggressive high-risk sexual behavior. Adolescent males internalize this and hold their peers to these expectations. These beliefs have detrimental SRH consequences that have yet to be fully understood among adolescent boys and males. The efficacy of future interventions will depend on further exploration of these topics, especially among minority populations.","Approved With Reservations  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.

117,Reviewer-MDsd,Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning with Conservative Bidirectional Rollouts,"Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) learns from an offline dataset without further interactions with the environment. Although such offline training patterns can avoid cost and damage in the real environment, one main challenge is the distributional shift between the state-action pairs visited by the learned policy and those in the offline dataset. Prevailed existing model-based offline RL approaches learn a dynamics model from the dataset and perform pessimistic policy optimization based on uncertainty estimation. However, the inaccurate quantification of model uncertainty may incur the poor generalization and performance of model-based approaches, especially in the datasets lacking of sample diversity. To tackle this limitation, we instead design a novel framework for model-based offline RL, named Conservative Offline Bidirectional Model-based Policy Optimization (abbr. as COBiMO). First, we learn an ensemble bidirectional model from the offline dataset and construct long bidirectional rollouts by joining two unidirectional ones, thereby increasing the diversity of the model rollouts. Second, we devise a conservative rollout method that minimizes the reconstruction loss, further improving the sample accuracy. We theoretically prove that the bound of rollout error of COBiMO is tighter than the ones using the unidirectional models. Empirical results also show that COBiMO outperforms previous offline RL algorithms on the widely used benchmark D4RL.","Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from the extrapolation error. There are numerous model-free and model-based offline RL algorithms that aim to tackle this challenge. Among them, model-based offline RL algorithms often learn a dynamics model from the dataset and perform pessimistic policy optimization based on uncertainty estimation. However, such quantifications are often inaccurate. This paper addresses this issue by training bidirectional dynamics models and rollout policies, and design a conservative rollout method that selects those synthetic transitions with the smallest reconstruction loss. The authors provide some theoretical analysis of their method and build their method upon some off-the-shelf model-free offline RL algorithms. # Strengths

The strengths can be summarized below:

- this paper is well-motivated, and the whole paper structure is clear

- the logic flow of this paper is clear, and it is easy to follow and understand

- the authors provide theoretical analysis to support their method # Weaknesses

Despite the aforementioned strengths, this paper has some flaws in novelty, empirical evaluation, and theoretical analysis. Based on these considerations, I can confirm that this paper is clearly under the acceptance bar of this venue. Please see the detailed comments below.

- (major) The core idea presented in this paper is NOT new. A highly relevant paper is published previously \[x\]. In \[x\], the authors also train bidirectional dynamics models and bidirectional rollout policies for offline data augmentation. Thus, the technical parts of this paper have a huge overlap with \[x\], making the contribution and significance of this paper quite weak. The differences are, that this paper selects the transitions with reconstruction loss while \[x\] selects reliable transitions via the proposed double check mechanism. It is doubtable whether the data selection approach adopted in this paper is better than the double check method, as intuitively, the reconstruction loss may not be reliable for forward/backward horizon larger than 1 (where no true next/previous states are available)

- (major) The empirical evaluations are limited and somewhat weak. The baseline algorithms this paper adopts are very old. It is somewhat confusing why the authors only choose to compare against these very weak algorithms. More advanced and recent offline RL algorithms ought to be included as the baselines (e.g., TD3BC, IQL, Decision Transformer, LAPO, etc.). The authors build their method upon CQL, BCQ, and BEAR. Can your method benefit more advanced offline RL algorithms?

- (major) This paper does not consider statistical significance. Written statements and the presentation of the results as tables (often without standard deviations) obscure this flaw. In fact, ALL tables in this paper does not include any signal of statistical significance, e.g., std, IQM. We have reached a point of maturity in the field where claims need to be made in reference to actual statistical evidence, which seems to be lacking in the current presentation.

- (major) The theoretical analysis is also not new. Similar techniques are adopted in the MBPO paper. Specifically, one online model-based RL algorithm BMPO \[y\] theoretically shows that the error of the bidirectional models is smaller than unidirectional models, making the theoretical insights of this paper less appealing and unsurprising.

- (minor) The authors ought to specify the version of the D4RL datasets they use in the paper. In Table 1, your evaluated scores in halfcheetah-medium-expert are questionably low, why is that?

- (minor) This paper does not do a good job in the related work part, the authors include too few recent offline model-based/model-free offline RL papers Please refer to the the weaknesses part.",603,0,3,0.7867000000000001,0.0567165212,0.9565235972,53,32.288,0.3178,iclr,0.0,4,4,4,5,factual,4,4,90,polite,4,negative,4,moderate,5,5,4,5,factual,5,5,85,polite,5,neutral,5,moderate,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,partially factual,1.0,2.0,60.0,neutral,3.0,negative,3.0,low,4,5,5,3,factual,3,4,75,polite,5,negative,5,low,3,4,4,4,factual,4,4,85,neutral,5,negative,5,low

The key technical contributions of the proposed model include: 1) It learns the bidirectional rollouts of the state transitions and the reward functions; 2) It learns forward and backward offline policies, following the BCQ method. With the learned bidirectional dynamics model and the corresponding policies, given a pivotal data point drawn from the offline dataset, the replay buffer can be augmented with the generated data trajectories. 

Additionally, the paper provides a theoretical analysis, establishing a tighter bound on the rollout error for the conservative bidirectional rollouts compared to unidirectional approaches. 

Finally, the empirical findings on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 1. The proposed method is simple, reasonable, and effective on the existing D4RL benchmark, showing great potential for practical offline RL applications. 
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The overall design of the proposed method is presented in a clear and thoroughly motivated manner. 
3. The method seems to be a highly versatile framework. As shown in the paper, it can be easily integrated with existing model-free offline RL approaches. 1. My primary concern with this paper is about the novelty of the proposed bidirectional rollout technique. At NeurIPS 2022, a paper titled ""Double Check Your State Before Trusting It: Confidence-Aware Bidirectional Offline Model-Based Imagination"" by Lyu et al. introduces a conceptually similar idea. In both papers, forward and backward models are trained to augment the offline dataset. It is crucial for the authors to address this similarity and provide a comprehensive comparison between COBiMO and the method presented by Lyu et al., considering aspects such as model design and empirical results.
2. In the experiment section, the authors present averaged results of 6 random seeds. To enhance the statistical robustness of their findings, it would be better to include the standard deviations over multiple runs in Tables 1-3. 
3. The paper primarily compares COBiMO with approaches that were proposed 2-3 years ago. It would be beneficial for the authors to extend their comparisons to include more recent advances in offline RL to provide a comprehensive evaluation of COBiMO's performance in the context of the most current state of the field.
4. In Section 5.3, there is an absence of an explanation regarding the factors that lead to performance degradation in certain tasks when COBiMO is applied (which can be reasonable but needs more analysis). Besides, as claimed in Section 5.3, the proposed method outperforms the original algorithms significantly in 10/12 tasks. However, it's essential to ensure that all relevant results supporting this claim are presented, as only a partial subset of the results is currently shown in Table 3.

63,Reviewer-osUg,Early Neuron Alignment in Two-layer ReLU Networks with Small Initialization,"This paper studies the problem of training a two-layer ReLU network for binary classification using gradient flow with small initialization. We consider a training dataset with well-separated input vectors: Any pair of input data with the same label are positively correlated, and any pair with different labels are negatively correlated. Our analysis shows that, during the early phase of training, neurons in the first layer try to align with either the positive data or the negative data, depending on its corresponding weight on the second layer. A careful analysis of the neurons' directional dynamics allows us to provide an $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log n}{\sqrt{\mu}})$ upper bound on the time it takes for all neurons to achieve good alignment with the input data, where $n$ is the number of data points and $\mu$ measures how well the data are separated. After the early alignment phase, the loss converges to zero at a $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{t})$ rate, and the weight matrix on the first layer is approximately low-rank. Numerical experiments on the MNIST dataset illustrate our theoretical findings.","The paper studies the problem of training a two-layer ReLU network for binary
classification using gradient flow with small initialization on well-separated input datasets, i.e. datasets $(x_i, y_i)_{i \in \[n\]}$ with $ \min \frac{\langle x_iy_i, x_jy_j  \rangle}{\Vert x_i \Vert_2 \Vert x_j \Vert_2 } \geq \mu$.
They show that in time $O(\frac{\log(n)}{\sqrt{\mu}})$ all neurons are well aligned with the input data, which means that positive neurons show in the same direction as the positively labeled points (or have a negative scalar prouct with all vectors of the dataset) (and an equivalent result for negative neurons).
Furhter they show that after the early alignment phase, the loss converges to zero at a $O(1/t)$ rate, and the weight
matrix on the first layer is approximately low-rank. Numerical experiments are provided. All claims are proven and illustrations are supporting the explanations. The assumption that the dataset is well seperated is very strong. I don't see why one would use a neural network on such a dataset rather than linear regression. -",167,0,2,0.7745000000000001,0.0306565657,0.9448035359,49,46.2312,0.1633,iclr,0.0,3,3,3,5,partially factual,3,2,45,polite,4,positive,3,moderate,2,4,4,2,factual,5,5,75,neutral,5,neutral,5,none,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,factual,3.0,4.0,70.0,polite,4.0,neutral,3.0,none,2,3,3,2,factual,3,3,60,neutral,4,neutral,4,low,2,4,3,3,factual,3,4,75,polite,5,neutral,4,low
64,Mohammad-Bodrul-Munir,"Effect of dietary protein level on growth, food utilization, food conversion and survival rate of giant trevally (Caranx ignobilis)","Background: Proper feed formulation is required for successful fish farming activities. Therefore, it is necessary for fish feed to provide optimal growth so that the cultivation business generates profits. Currently, there is very limited information about the appropriate feed for Caranx ignobilis, causing problems with its development. This study aims to provide feed with different protein levels to C. ignobilis. Methods: We will examine the protein levels’ effects on the daily growth rate (DGR), specific growth rate (SGR), absolute growth rate (AGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), feed efficiency (FE), and survival rate (SR). This research was conducted for 35 days, from June to October 2017, at the Center Brackiswater Aquaculture Development (BPBAP) Ujung Batee, Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, Aceh Besar, Indonesia. This study used a completely randomized design method, with five treatment levels (30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 70% protein feed) and four replications. Results: The results showed that feeding with different proteins on C. ignobilis had a significant effect on the mean values ​​of DGR, SGR, AGR, FCR, FE, and SR. The 50% protein feed gave the best results for C. ignobilis, with a mean DGR value of 0.267 ± 0.005 g / day, a mean SGR of 1.722 ± 0.030% / day, a mean AGR of 0.081 ± 0.003 cm/day, a mean FCR of 1.290, a mean FE 77.755% and a mean SR was 86.667%. Conclusions: Furthermore, feed treatment with increased protein content between 30%–50% has a positive correlation with the growth of C. ignobilis. However, the ability to grow fish will decrease if the feed protein content is >50%.","Not Approved  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.

76,Ghislain-Hachey,Facilitating Data Discovery by Connecting Related Resources ,"In this study, we investigate two approaches to increase the discoverability and connectivity of resources on the web.

Although there as been a lot of work on automatic discovery and connectivity of web resources, not a lot of quality work has been done to rigorously evaluate the alternatives so I think this work is important and original as far as I know. That being said, I have several problems with the research as it is now. The results feel more like anecdotal evidence than rigorous scientific analysis. The paper started with a rather interesting (and essential) idea which was to investigate discoverability and connectivity of resources on the Web. For such a study I would expect a carefully crafted questionaire or at least a clear list of criteria to look for and to grade the three studied scientific projects with regards to the investigated approaches in a systematic manner. I understand this paper's purpose is not to conduct of survey, but it seems the main purpose is to ""investigate"" and as such I think maybe some elements of good evaluation papers such as [1,2,3] might provide insight into how to improve this research. The discussion section sort of integrates criteria for an evaluation, but too informally. The criteria should be presented early in the scientific method used. After which experiment can be conducted based on the criteria and *then* discuss results. I do find the discussions to be an interesting read but as they are now they can not be considered as scientific evidence. It is false to claim that Semantic web-enabled vocabularies are ""innumerable""; there is in fact a relatively small (but growing) set of them mainly in scientific communities. A simple wording re-adjustment would be better I think. The method of investigation would need to be more clearly explained too. The paper moves from giving some background information (which I really like as some of this was new to me) to providing results. There is a clear gap in outlining the Methodology used. It should be explicit (and repeatable) how results are to be compiled and right now I would find it hard to reproduce this evaluation/investigation. The style of writing is formal and appropriate, but there are several grammatical errors and typos that could have been easily avoided. Here's some examples: - p.6 filesfor missing space. - p.6 wasmanually missing space. - p.7 of of remove an 'of'. - p.8 reearch missing 's'. - p.9 regulariety ?!? Finally, this seems to be outside the scope of the SWI SWJ Special issue. I would encourage the authors to continue this important work though and maybe go through a conference first (if not done so already). However, I do not think it is ready for journal publication of original work. To summarise, the paper provides clear introductory text even for those new to the concepts discussed, but does not contain the required overall balance: almost half the paper is on background information and much missing in terms of methodology, results and discussions. The paper reads very well and I would definitely enjoy reading another more structured and rigorous version of it. It think the suject explored is critical, but the community would benefit from a more scientifically sound evaluation. [1] T. Dyba and T. Dingsøyr.

After a long and overly general preamble, the authors describe two efforts to annotate three different datasets with metadata in RDF and schema.org microdata. The premise is that doing so will make the datasets more discoverable and better connected, but this conjecture is never tested. It is not even discussed what ""more discoverable"" or ""better connected"" would mean in practice, nor are concrete, measurable objectives suggested. Moreover, the two methods discussed seem somewhat incomparable: schema.org can, as the authors note, be used to affect search rankings. RDF metadata, however, requires another tool - such as Sindice or something similar - to find and process the published RDF. Attempting to compare apparently incomparable approaches leaves the reader little the wiser; the more so when no conclusions are drawn. The paper has many minor errors, too many typos, and many places where claims are made without citation. Thorough proofreading is required. Among the more concerning errors: * ""in order to find something, it must be named"" (section 1). I disagree: anonymous things may be found, by their description. Perhaps it would be better to say ""in order to find something, it must be identified"", where identification is taken to include both naming and identifying reference expressions. * ""actionable identifiers"" (section 2). The action of an identifier is to identify; therefore ""actionable identifier"" is a tautology. Later in this section, the authors appear to mean ""resolvable"" rather than ""actionable"". * ""Web 3.0 is essentially a way to bridge the gap between human users and computerized applications"". I'm not sure quite what this means, but humans have been using computerized applications, successfully, for a long time. To the extent that Web 3.0 means anything (other than a rather vague marketing term), I don't believe that it means this. * "" Resource Description Framework ... is a standard"" (section 3.1). Not being an accredited standards body, the W3C is careful to state that it makes recommendations, not that it sets standards. This should perhaps read ""... is a specification"" * ""RDF is built from XML triples"" (section 3.1). This is most emphatically wrong. RDF and XML are completely orthoganal: one can encode RDF using XML, but XML is not fundamental to the definition of RDF. * ""RDF vocabularies are declared via namespace designations"" (section 3.1). Also incorrect. * ""Prior to ORE, groups of related resources could not be made visible on the web via URLs"" (section 3.2). I'm not sure what the authors are trying to convey here, but I disagree. Collections can be described in HTML as ul/li lists, or in RDF with seq and bag, or simply by publishing a list of URLs in a text file. * ""on a finite project"" (section 4). Are there infinite projects? * ""RDF requires a triple store, which may be overwhelming to [..] users. It is based on XML"" (section 6.1). Users do not need a triple store to publish and make use of RDF metadata, they only need a tool which can process it. Semantic web search engines, such as Sindice, can do this without the user ever creating a triple store themselves. Also, as noted above, RDF is not based on XML. * Section 6 is correctly labelled discussion, which is all that it does. It would be more helpful to the reader if it were labelled ""Evaluation"", and then proceeded to evaluate the different metadata and identification approaches against measurable criteria. It is not apparent to me that an dataset creator wishing to make their dataset more discoverable could use the results of this paper as anything other than general background to a decision about how, and where, to publish metadata on the dataset.",640,0,2,0.7908000000000001,0.1162368881,0.8519799113000001,34,47.59,0.2025,semanticweb,0.0,3,5,5,3,factual,5,5,95,polite,5,negative,5,none,4,5,4,4,factual,4,5,85,neutral,5,negative,5,none,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,unfactual,2.0,1.0,40.0,neutral,3.0,negative,3.0,moderate,3,5,5,3,factual,4,5,85,neutral,5,negative,5,none,3,4,4,4,factual,3,4,78,neutral,5,negative,5,low

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  The manuscript by Natasha Thorn and colleagues entitled, “GBS vaccines in the UK: a round table discussion” presents a compelling discussion of the status of a protective vaccine against Group B Streptococcus, an important perinatal pathogen.  This manuscript is full of important information about disease risk from GBS infection and gaps in current treatment and prevention strategies.  There are many positive aspects about this manuscript that I would like to highlight.  First, the authors are extremely deliberate in their use of language, specifically referring to “pregnant patients” and “pregnant people”.  This is a subtle but important aspect of discussing these populations without introducing highly gendered language. Excellent work. The inclusion of stakeholders in the community such as Midwives was also a strength as these providers have the capacity to meet individuals who may be unaware of GBS risk and/or vaccine hesitant.  Buy-in from these groups will help with deployment in the future. Comparing/contrasting efficacy of other vaccination programmes deployed in pregnant patients was also a strength of this manuscript. I have a few comments to improve the quality of the manuscript. 1.  The authors mention AMR very briefly in the second paragraph of the Introduction.  It would be helpful to expand this section to acknowledge that the standard first line therapeutic choice for GBS is penicillin, but up to 10% of populations report penicillin hypersensitivity. Second line choice is often erythromycin or clindamycin and emerging clinical strains are exhibiting high resistance to these drugs (about 40% of strains are resistant).  2.  First line of the Introduction.  The authors refer to Group B streptococcus and italicize the word “streptococcus” but leave it lowercase.  If the authors are referring to the genus, this word should be capitalized and italicized. If they are referring to general morphology and arrangement of bacteria it can be lowercase but should not be italicized.  Most common references to GBS use the former (genus nomenclature).

The article provides a concise and well-rounded update to the current status of GBS Vaccines, including an appropriate focus on knowledge gaps and barriers to success with useful recommendations for how to address them.

I have a few minor comments which may improve readability of the manuscript. 1) There is some repetition of points throughout, likely due to the nature of the manuscript as proceedings of a meeting. The authors could clean up the narrative, for example on page four, two subsequent paragraphs have the same conclusion regarding the need for improved surveillance.  2) Different acronyms are used to refer to the same thing (e.g. EOGBS, EOD and EO disease are all used in the first page) and some acronyms are never expanded (e.g. UR when discussing case estimates).  3) It would be good to have references and links provided for the burden of disease data used, acknowledging that some data is as yet unpublished.

The authors used a subset of Attempto Controlled English (ACE) implemented in Grammatical Framework (GF) to support bidirectional automatic translations between ACE and language fragments of a number of other natural languages in their semantic wiki. With this approach users speaking different languages can collaboratively build and manage a knowledge base.  The semantic wiki system was evaluated in a study with 30 participants speaking 3 different languages. For each language, there were 10 participants. In the study users had two tasks: users had to create articles in their native language or in a language they were fluent in as well as to read automatically translated articles to evaluate the truth or falsehood of the translation. The evaluation shows that users reach a high level of consensus. The evaluation also shows that the automatic translation does not have a negative effect.  In total, the article is well written and related to the state of the art. The authors clearly identify their contribution to the state of the art, i.e. making a semantic wiki environment multilingual, and evaluate whether their contribution addresses the identified problems around creating a multilingual ontology in a semantic wiki system.

The novelty in this paper is to investigate this in the multi-lingual case. CNL statements, transformed into OWL, can here not only be given in different languages (here in particular in Englishm German, and Spanish) but also translated arcross language boundaries facilitating using wiki CNL in different languages. The paper expands the authors' recent ESWC 2013 paper. The topic is clearly suitable for the topic of the special issue. The research problem and methods used for attacking it are clearly stated. Related work is discussed in a separate section, which seems adequate, although I am not an expert in this particular field.  The papers cover a great deal of work related to the underlying tools and new experiments, with illustrative examples and pointers to further sources. After presenting the framework, the quality of the translations arcross natural languages is evaluated and results analysed in careful way. The language and presentation is exceptionally well polished. In short, this looks like solid work worth publishing. My main concern about the paper is related to the general idea of using CNL as a basis in wikis in general. What would be the *realistic* use case problem for a system like this, and how well would it then actually solve the problem of collaboarative multilingual ontology creation? The paper concerns a toy example of countries, rivers etc. It is good to use such examples in a research setting, but it would be nice if the authors could shortly discuss this bigger question and e.g. motive the reader by examples of more serious CNL-based wikis and OWL ontologies - are there useful systems already and what are the challenges? It is a challenge, if a group of people start inputting CNL OWL expressions in a wiki, and this should coverge into something logically consistent and useful. Some challenges encountered in the evaluation section are discussed, e.g., different opinions people may have about geography, which leads to inconsistency. It is also said in the paper that 80% of the users could not express themselves as they liked in the experiment. In footnote 9 the authors point the reader to ""demo wikis"",  but I could not find any realistic applications or datasets there. The video there was for some reason not operational.

I'm confident that this will become an important linked data set in the future. While there is no doubt about the dataset's importance, improvements are necessary to make it easily accessible to a larger audience. The description of the dataset lacks sufficient clarity and detail to be useful to the novice user. The description of the dataset in Section 2 needs to be elaborated (adding detail and precision). Lists/tables and simple statistics could help address this issue (compare previous LOD papers in the journal). Furthermore, the figures need to be better tied in by explaining the depicted relationships and using them as examples in Sec. 2. The authors remain vague on the maturity of the dataset, which is a concern, though it might be less pressing once sufficient detail is provided. The current state (what is there, what is missing) should be stated more explicit. While some major rewriting/editing is necessary, I see no technical problems with the described data set. The raised issues about clarity/accessibility to the community at-large can be easily fixed. I support accepting this paper contingent on ""the lack of detail and clarity"" issue being addressed. More details on the 3 evaluation criteria: (1) Quality of the dataset.  I have no doubt that the relationships between the included logics and languages are correctly captured. However, the maturity/completeness of the dataset is an issue: as I understand it, not all mappings/relations between logics and languages are included yet. Be clear about which ones have been modeled and which are left for the future. As a side issue: While one cannot reasonably expect the dataset to ever be complete, some mechanisms for the inexistence of mappings/translations could be helpful to differentiate between non-mappability and incomplete knowledge. I'm not sure whether that is within the scope of the OntoIOp registry. (2) Usefulness (or potential usefulness) of the dataset.  The usefulness is not as clearly visible as would be desirable. Neither Hets nor Ontohub use the dataset, though potential future applications are hinted at. The authors do provide some example queries that help understand how the dataset may be useful by itself. (3) Clarity and completeness of the descriptions This is my chief concern. For a LOD description, I expect more detail than what is provided in Section 2. While the explanation of the provenance is sufficient, the explanation of what the dataset describes requires elaboration. This should be at a level that non-logicians can understand the basic ideas and use the LOD. For example, you need to explain the difference between logics and languages -- this will not be clear to most users (as often one language is associated with a single logic and vice versa). Also, a better explanation of the intuitions behind ""mapping"", ""translation"", ""serialization"", ""sublanguage"", etc. are needed. Explain why mappings/translations are modeled as types as opposed to binary relations.  The current scope of the LOD is a bit vague, some lists/tables to summarize the dataset would be very helpful: - explain the kind of items  (maybe each of the ""subdirectories"" of the URLs) from http://purl.net/dol/registry that are reflected in the directories in http://purl.net/dol/ - how many of each of the types of items and relationships does the dataset include? - list & briefly explain the kinds of mappings available, it wouldn't hurt to include the hierarchy of mapping relations from [13] - what languages and logics are currently included? Given the manageable scope of 29 logics, 43 translations, and 14 languages, it would be easily to list them in a table/figure. The figures could be more helpful by explaining what the depicted relations in Fig 1 and 2 are: most, I believe, are mappings (though I'm not sure whether sublanguage relations are mappings; at the beginning of Sec. 2 mappings are restricted to logics), but also serializations are included. Are the color coding of expressivity/decidability in Fig. 2 captured in the dataset? Some minimal working example would be very helpful: one (or more) logics with one (or more) languages and two serializations as well as mappings to other logics/languages and metadata (showing how VoID and SKOS are utilized). Lesser, though more general concerns about the described project/dataset: 1) The maturity/completeness of the LOD: the OntoIOp registry is still very much under development. While publication on the underlying research are very valuable, I'm note sure about the value of a description of the registry's LOD at this stage. It seems highly likely that the description will be outdated as soon as it is published. That defeats the purpose of describing the dataset to others for them to use/reuse. 2) ability for others to contribute: the purpose of the registry is to enable the community to contribute descriptions of languages, logics, and translations. However, for maintaining the registry, the authors propose to generate it automatically from Hets. This is counter to the desired openness: it would require others to first extend Hets instead of directly contributing to the directory/dataset. I personally think that the LOD should not be permanently tied to any specific software, which poses a significant barrier for the community to contribute. Other mechanisms for maintaining/updating the registry are needed.  Other things that need to be fixed in the final version: - given that the paper is less than 5 pages in content, the abstract is unnecessarily long. It includes much background information (2nd paragraph, 1st sentence of 3rd paragraph, last paragraph) that should better be placed in the main part. - p 4: last paragraph of Sec. 3 needs a rewrite to improve clarity - if possible, the wealth of technical terminology should be reduced to what is essential. This is not supposed to be a description of the entire OntoIOp project, but of the dataset only. You also need to more clearly separate and exlain differences between the DOL language, Lola vocabulary and the language of the OntoIOp registry at the beginning and clearly distinguish between what is a project (OntoIOp) vs. an artifact (registry, DOL, Lola) - I can't quite appreciate the relevance of the example on p. 2 as it only uses the language and syntax statements that relate to the registry. - The URl to Lola on p. 3 needs to be updated",1049,3,1,0.7569,0.0961049107,0.8967276216000001,35,44.85,0.8064,semanticweb,0.0309278350515463,4,4,5,4,factual,3,4,88,neutral,4,negative,4,none,5,4,4,5,factual,4,5,85,polite,5,neutral,4,moderate,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,factual,4.0,5.0,80.0,polite,4.0,neutral,3.0,low,5,4,5,5,factual,5,5,90,polite,5,positive,5,low,3,3,4,4,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,3,low

In general, I find the dataset really interesting and promising for combining and integrating information from different ontology registries and translation between logics. For the organization of the review I will follow the dimensions established by the type of submission:  (1) Quality of the dataset.   One of the main shortcomings of the paper is that the SPARQL endpoint where one could try the queries in the paper or others is not explicitly referenced from the text nor in http://ontoiop.org/. It should be included in Table 1.  A VoID description of the dataset is claimed to provide metadata from the dataset in page 3 however I haven't been able to find it either. It would be nice to have a footnote with it or include it also in Table 1. Adding the dataset description to a dataset registry (for example http://datahub.io/) and providing the reference to the resource entry in the datahub would be also advisable.  In the text it is said ""the OntoIOp Registry, with LoLa being its main vocabulary, gets four stars"" and ""the OntoIOp Registry is unique in being a linked dataset covering the domain of OMS languages"" considering that the linked part of the 5-star ranking is precisely the 5th one these two sentences seems contradictory. Either the dataset is linked, being 5-star, or it should establish links to other dataset to be possible to claim the second sentence as for ""linked"". In general I would suggest reviewing the 5 star ranking and proof that the dataset is actually a linked dataset.  (2) Usefulness (or potential usefulness) of the dataset.   While thinking that the described dataset will be surely interesting and useful it would be welcome to read a bit more about motivation and potential uses apart from those in Ontohub and Hets. The current state of the paper gives me a feeling of the dataset were an ad-hoc development for these systems (Ontohub and Hets) and seeing some examples of uses out of this context would increase greatly the dataset value.  (3) Clarity and completeness of the descriptions.   Main concerns about clarity is the distinction between DOL and LoLa. It is not clear which ontology is used in dataset. At the beginning it seems like LoLa is the actual implementation of DOL for this dataset however in section 3 the URI of reference for LoLa contains ""dol"" and in the SPARQL query examples the prefix dol is used. In addition, the URI for LoLa gives a 404 errors (I tried to browse it several times in different weeks).   It would also be valuable including a diagram of the LoLa's main classes and properties as the current figures are example of instances from what I understand. --- Other comments --- Figure 2 is not referenced in the text. Is it nice to reference and describe within the text all figures and tables appearing in the paper. In the first query in page 5 the selected variable is ""?target-language"" that do not appear in the query, in the query body it appears ""?targetLanguage"" instead. I would like to see some concrete metrics about number of triples and outbound links to other datasets. The information about metrics in section 5 seems not clear about specific figures, see ""around three times as many triples as the core dataset"" Typo: Section 5 ""Thus, the expanded dataset has around three times as many triples as as.."" --> only one ""as""",579,2,0,0.7136,0.1711382114,0.8930797577,52,50.57,0.103,semanticweb,0.0,3,4,4,3,partially factual,4,3,77,polite,3,neutral,4,low,5,5,5,5,factual,5,5,95,polite,5,neutral,5,low,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,partially factual,4.0,4.0,70.0,polite,5.0,neutral,3.0,low,5,5,5,5,factual,5,5,95,polite,5,neutral,5,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low

As a general comment, I thing the representation used is reasonably elegant, and I can see some value in having such a map of languages and logics available. However, it is very hard to extract, from the paper, how useful the dataset currently is, or what is its potential for impact. I also think that the a bit of additional work in improving access to the dataset, the scope of the content and the connections with external resources would help in improving and demonstrating the value of the dataset. In more details (1) Quality of the dataset The representation of the languages, logics and mappings seem reasonable. The authors argue that there is no other ontology covering these aspects, and I indeed don't know any myself. It would be good however to include more information, in the related work section, about some other metadata descriptions for ontologies/information resources, that overlap to an extent with the one presented here. For example, a clear explanation of what is added by the ontology compared to OMV or to the schema used by common ontology repositories would be useful. Generally, a more complete comparison with other works that are not intended for the same task, but that overlap (e.g. ontology repositories, VoID, etc.) would be useful. Although the information in the repository is modelled in a reasonable way, the content in itself is very small. That is not an issue in itself, but it certainly affects the usefulness as the scope of the dataset is very limited. One could argue that a dataset and a classification are different things, and that this is closer to a classification of languages. The paper mentions that their are links to other datasets included, but going through a few resources, I couldn't find any. More details about that would certainly be needed. Not directly related to the quality of the dataset, but to the ease of using it, it would have been good to also include other common forms of access to the data than resolving URIs to RDF, and a dump. A SPARQL endpoint as well as html documentation of the entities included (i.e. URIs resolving to human-readable documents too) would have been appreciated. (2) Usefulness The paper includes ideas about tools that could be using the dataset and an example query. This is interesting of course, but at the same time it is very hard to understand from what is written what is the real (current and potential) impact of the dataset. How much and how is it used currently? What is the demand for such information? How does the group plan to address this demand? The paper mentions sustainability, and honestly states that this is not a resolved issue. While this is understandable, and the case of many other datasets out there, it is also slightly worrying if the ambition for this is to become a reference point for others when describing resources related to languages, logics and their mappings. I can certainly see that happening, but again, as mentioned above, it would make the paper stronger if such an ambition was made explicit, with a clear view of how that might happen in the future if it has not done so yet. As an aside, I believe that this issue could be helped by extending the scope of the dataset a bit, importing from existing repositories of ontologies (TONES, BioPortal, Watson, etc.) their metadata and enriching them with information about the language/logics they rely on.

57,Reviewer-Mh63,Diversified Outlier Exposure for Out-of-Distribution Detection via Informative Extrapolation,"Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is important for deploying reliable machine learning models on real-world applications. Recent advances in outlier exposure have shown promising results on OOD detection via fine-tuning model with informatively sampled auxiliary outliers. However, previous methods assume that the collected outliers can be sufficiently large and representative to cover the boundary between ID and OOD data, which might be impractical and challenging. In this work, we propose a novel framework, namely, Diversified Outlier Exposure (DivOE), for effective OOD detection via informative extrapolation based on the given auxiliary outliers. Specifically, DivOE introduces a new learning objective, which diversifies the auxiliary distribution by explicitly synthesizing more informative outliers for extrapolation during training. It leverages a multi-step optimization method to generate novel outliers beyond the original ones, which is compatible with many variants of outlier exposure. Extensive experiments and analyses have been conducted to characterize and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DivOE. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/DivOE.","The authors of this paper present an innovative methodology for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. While existing methodologies typically involve the direct use of given OOD samples, this paper introduces a new approach that applies perturbations to OOD samples, allowing the model to experience a more diverse set of OOD samples during training.

The authors define these perturbations using an adversarial loss based on the uniform distribution loss commonly applied to OOD samples. This creates directional guidance for each instance, determining the direction of the gradient and thus defining the perturbations applied to OOD samples.

The results demonstrate that using perturbed OOD samples improves the performance of OOD detection across several key metrics, including False Positive Rate at 95% Recall (FPR95), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC), and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPR), when compared to existing methodologies. This paper's novel approach of applying perturbations to a given data instance in order to utilize a broader array of samples and those tightly located at the decision boundary is indeed a reasonable and intriguing choice. The authors' concept of adversariality against the uniform loss, which implies a concentration of prediction towards a particular class, exhibits an interesting property worth exploring further.

Experimentally, the authors provide a substantial ablation study on the hyperparameters used in loss composition, which adds to the comprehensiveness of their methodology. Notably, the use of t-SNE based plotting allows for a clear visualization of how the OOD samples are perturbed to be situated very closely to in-class samples. It also arise the question of ""how would ood behave for the different perturbation types?"". The authors have presented an interesting methodology that applies adversarial perturbations based on a particular loss function to enhance the performance of out-of-distribution detection. However, it would be important for the authors to provide empirical evidence that demonstrates the superiority of this adversarial perturbation over other types of perturbations. This would require a systematic and rigorous experimentation design and would ideally be conducted across various datasets and under different conditions to ensure the results are robust and generalizable.

In the final implementation of the authors' methodology, it's noted that both the perturbed and unperturbed out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are simultaneously considered in the loss function. However, the manuscript doesn't sufficiently explain the rationale behind this particular choice. It would be particularly interesting to see a comparison of results when using only perturbed samples, only unperturbed samples, or both, in the loss function. 

a crucial aspect that needs further clarification and discussion is the ratio of in-distribution to OOD samples used in the training process. The choice of this ratio can significantly affect the performance and robustness of the model. For instance, a too high proportion of OOD samples could make the model overly sensitive to outliers, while a too low proportion might not adequately expose the model to OOD scenarios.

While the paper shows promising results in the specific contexts tested, it would be beneficial for the authors to provide a more extensive analysis covering a range of different OOD datasets. If the authors can provide empirical evidence demonstrating the consistent performance of their method across diverse OOD datasets, it would significantly strengthen their claims. 

it's unclear from the manuscript how each OOD sample is directed towards a specific class during this adversarial perturbation process. Specifically, they should explain how the gradient direction, which determines the perturbations applied to the OOD samples, correlates with the movement of these samples towards specific classes.

I am more than eager to increase my score if the questions above are adequately answered.

The negative data is often limited and therefore cannot fully encompass the distribution of inliers. Consequently, contemporary learning procedures fail to deliver classifiers resilient to outliers. To overcome this issue, the manuscript presents a method for extrapolating the negative data towards all modes of the inlier distribution. The proposed method first calculates the gradient of arbitrary OOD score over the input. Then, the sign of the gradient is used to direct the negative input samples towards the inlier distribution. The final learning algorithm uses both initial and extrapolated auxiliary negatives to train the classifier resilient to outliers. The proposed method outperforms relevant related works on small image benchmarks. S1. The manuscript deals with an important issue.

S2. Extrapolation of auxiliary negative data towards modes of inlier distribution intuitively makes sense.

S3. The developed method achieves competitive results on considered benchmarks.

S4. The developed method can be combined with existing OOD detectors (e.g. Energy, MSP, ... ) W1.  The manuscript does not discuss the effectiveness of the method when there is only a small auxiliary dataset available. It seems that the developed method still requires a broad OE dataset (Tiny-ImageNet as stated in L236).

W2. The manuscript does not consider relevant related works which use synthetic negatives created by generative models \[a,b,c\]. Synthetic negatives are an effective way for augmenting the auxiliary dataset and the proposed method should outperform methods trained on a mixture of real and synthetic negative data.

W4. The manuscript does not reflect on the additional computational budget (time and memory) required by the method over the OE baseline.

The target private category is set as the unknown class during the adaptation process, as it is not included in the source domain. However, most existing methods overlook the intra-class structure within a category, especially in cases where there exists significant concept shift between the samples belonging to the same category. When samples with large concept shift are forced to be pushed together, it may negatively affect the adaptation performance. Moreover, from the interpretability aspect, it is unreasonable to align visual features with significant differences, such as fighter jets and civil aircraft, into the same category.

 1, Why can sub-prototypes benefit the universal domain adaptation scenario? 
I understand that, even within a domain, samples from the same class can be grouped into sub-classes. But, a critical part is missing why this helps the cross-domain association of common classes. which is the core problem for universal domain adaptation. An explanation or empirical justification is needed here, i.e., what is the pattern of retrieved sub-prototypes for common samples and private ones? 

2, Some technical details are not comprehensive enough. 
1) Is the memory learnable parameters? How to initialize them? This can be basic knowledge for people familiar with this, but it is still necessary to briefly detail this. 
2) After reading sec 3.5,  it is still unclear to be how the sub-prototypes help align the embeddings \hat{Z}. 

3, In Fig. 1 (c), does this method assume the sub-class of two domains can be matched? This seems unrealistic under the distribution shift.

The goal is to adapt a classifier from source to target domain such that both source and target domains may have their own private classes apart from shared classes. The paper claims that existing UniDA methods overlook the intrinsic structure in the categories, which leads to suboptimal feature learning and adaptation. Hence, they propose memory-assisted sub-prototype mining (MemSPM) that learns sub-prototypes in a memory mechanism to embody the subclasses from the source data. Then, for target samples, weighted sub-prototype sampling is used before passing the embedding to a classifier, which results in reduced domain shift for the embedding. They also propose an adaptive thresholding technique to select relevant sub-prototypes. Finally, they adopt the cycle consistent matching loss objective from DCC \[24\] along with an auxiliary reconstruction loss for training. They show results on UniDA, Partial DA, and Open-Set DA using standard benchmarks like Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA, and DomainNet. * The motivating ideas for the approach are interesting and intuitive. Further, the technical contributions are novel as well as effective.

* It is intriguing that the auxiliary reconstruction task provides interpretability, which is usually not possible in existing DA solutions.

* The paper is fairly easy to follow (with the exception of some equations and many typos and grammatical errors, see Weaknesses).

* With their method and the advantages of a CLIP-pretrained ViT model, they achieve large improvements over existing ResNet-based methods. While they also show small improvements over some existing methods using the CLIP-pretrained model, this can serve as a new strong baseline for future UniDA work. * The paper claims that existing UniDA works overlook the internal intrinsic structure in the categories. 
    * However, \[W1\] aims to resolve the same problem. \[W1\] proposes to learn lower-level visual primitives that are unaffected by the category shift in the higher-level features. And, in their proposed word-prototype-space, different visual primitives can be shared across domains and classes (including unknown classes).
    * There is a significant overlap in the motivation given by this paper and that of \[W1\]. Consequently, the high-level conceptual novelty of this paper is overclaimed. However, I do believe that these conceptual ideas are interesting as well as important for UniDA.
    * Please discuss the similarities and differences (both in terms of motivation and the actual approach) of this paper w.r.t. \[W1\].
    * Another paper with similar conceptual ideas is \[W2\].

* This paper lacks some mathematical rigor.
    * Eq. 1, 2: $\hat{Z}=W\cdot M$ is shown as matrix multiplication (I assume that it is not element-wise multiplication since dimensions of $W$ and $M$ are different), but the expansion of this matrix multiplication contains an arg-max over the elements of $W$. Then, it does not make sense for the overall computation to be a standard matrix multiplication.
    * Eq. 1, 2: the text mentions that $s_i$ is the index of sub-prototypes in the $i^\text{th}$ item but Eq. 2 implies that $s_i$ is a particular dimension found with arg-max. This seems contradictory and is confusing.
    * Eq. 2: Use $\mathop{\arg\max}_{j}$ instead of using `dim=1` since it is a mathematical equation and not the code implementation.
    * Eq. 5: It is unclear which dimension is used for top-$k$
    * Eq. 6: It should be $\max(... , 0)$ instead of just $\max(...)$.

* The requirement of a CLIP-pretrained backbone is very restrictive since the method cannot be extended to other settings (like medical imaging) where the CLIP-pretraining may be suboptimal. While the paper shows comparisons where prior methods use the CLIP-pretrained model, it should also show comparisons when starting from a random initialization as well as the more widely used ImageNet initialization.
    * The paper claims that a CLIP backbone is needed to retrieve sub-prototypes in early iterations. Why not start retrieving sub-prototypes after a few epochs of normal training?

* L135: “eliminates the domain-specific information from the target domain”. This is a very strong claim which does not seem to be backed by evidence. Performing “domain alignment” is not the same as “eliminating” domain-specific information. Further, as we can see from Fig. 3, the sub-prototypes seem to be retaining domain-specific information.

* There are no sensitivity analyses for the several loss-balancing hyperparameters $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ (not even in the Supplementary). While the paper claims to have borrowed them from DCC, this approach is vastly different from DCC, and we need to check for sensitivity to these hyperparameters. Further, DCC does not have a reconstruction loss, so it is unclear how that hyperparameter is selected.

* There is no ablation study for the adaptive threshold $\lambda$. It should be compared to various fixed thresholds and the value of the adaptive threshold should also be plotted over the course of training to obtain more insights into its working.

* Other UniDA works, like OVANet \[40\] and \[W1\], study the sensitivity of their methods to the degree of openness (i.e. the number of shared/private classes) which changes the difficulty of the UniDA problem. This analysis is missing in this paper. This should be shown for a better understanding of the capabilities of the proposed method.

42,Reviewer-qbM5,Convergence of Actor-Critic with Multi-Layer Neural Networks,"The early theory of actor-critic methods considered convergence using linear function approximators for the policy and value functions. Recent work has established convergence using neural network approximators with a single hidden layer. In this work we are taking the natural next step and establish convergence using deep neural networks with an arbitrary number of hidden layers, thus closing a gap between theory and practice. We show that actor-critic updates projected on a ball around the initial condition will converge to a neighborhood where the average of the squared gradients is $\tilde{O} \left( 1/\sqrt{m} \right) + O \left( \epsilon \right)$, with $m$ being the width of the neural network and $\epsilon$ the approximation quality of the best critic neural network over the projected set.","The paper proposes an analysis of the the actor critic setting with function approximator and it proves the convergence using deep neural networks with an arbitrary number of hidden layers. The claims are ambitious. The analysis of the paper sidesteps many key elements from the literature that contradicts the possibility to have a critic that provably converges when using non-linear function approximators, let alone when combined with an actor. When learning with the Bellman iterations, a compounding of errors can occur due to the non-linearity of the function approximator with respect to the parameters, which can lead to divergence even with the continuity and Lipschitz assumptions as described in the paper.

The discussion from Section 4.2 is also not convincing. 

Additional comments:
- line 77: the reward function goes into $R$, but what is R? Did the authors mean the real numbers $\mathbb R$?
- Many discussion points lack a precise formalization, e.g. line 248: ""Such an analysis is inherently more technically challenging, since when the actor can wait for the critic to go through sufficiently many iterations, one could argue that the resulting Q-values are approximately accurate and the process resembles gradient descent."" Why do the examples of off-policy divergence not apply in your analysis (see for instance Sutton and Barto intro to RL book in Section 11.2 ""Examples of Off-policy Divergence""). Limitations are not really discussed and it might be that some of the claims (see questions above) are not correct.",243,0,0,0.8078000000000001,0.1497916667,0.9431985021,215,38.8276,0.0587,neurips,0.0306122448979592,1,3,2,2,factual,3,2,50,neutral,3,neutral,3,moderate,3,4,4,3,partially factual,4,4,65,neutral,5,negative,5,moderate,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,partially factual,1.0,2.0,60.0,neutral,3.0,negative,3.0,low,2,3,3,2,partially factual,3,3,50,neutral,4,negative,4,moderate,2,4,3,3,partially factual,3,3,65,neutral,4,negative,4,low

Note: I have not gone through the full proof in the appendix and thus cannot fully comment on the validity of the main contributions. The paper is very well written and the ideas are clearly communicated. I especially appreciate the tables and figures to aid in explaining the approach and how it fits into the literature.

The main theorem is a very interesting theoretical result. There are a few parts of the paper where the presentation could be improved a bit, but for the most part I thought the paper was very clearly written. Your final bound does not appear to be affected by the depth of the NN approximator, but clearly depth does improve approximation error. Does a tighter bound exist that takes into account depth or would depth mostly be captured in the \epsilon error term?

On line 135, you refer to \sigma_w, but I don't see that variable defined. What is that referring to?

In Assumption 2.6, what is the gradient of w with respect to?

Small notes:
I would recommend having all equation statements be numbered so it's easier for readers to refer to them.

I find the notation on the equation in line 161 a bit confusing, namely that Q refers to both a function that takes in weights and outputs a Q-function and the Q-function itself.

 - Writing is of very high quality, with well-considered notation, and sensible flow.

- The problem statement is clear, and it is supported by required references.

- The problem is important, and the paper furthers our understanding of the behaviour of RL with function approximation using deep neural networks.
 - A few small typos can be found in the paper. E.g., in line 28 ""was consider in"". A few articles are also missing in various places.

- In the paper, the authors emphasize the need to stay close to the initial conditions of the critic (e.g. in Sec. 2.4). This makes sense from the regularisation point of view in general, but in RL, this may mean that the optimial policy may not be found if the algorithm is forced to say close to the initial conditions. Perhaps the motivation and the consequences of staying close to the initial conditions could be clarified.

- Consider Eq. (9), and assume that $\epsilon$ is small, but higher than 0. Even if $\epsilon$ is very small, the best action may change when a lover Q-value is allowed, i.e., the best action determined by $\theta_t$ may be different from the best action according to $Q(s,a)$. Do the smoothness assumptions made through the paper help to cope with the change of the best action in this case? Note that small $\epsilon$ may not be sufficient to make the result significant since the policy itself may be affected even when $\epsilon$ is tiny.

In line 201, the authors say that $C$, $\beta$, and $\mu_\min$ do not depend on $\theta$. But, I am not sure if this is true for $\mu_\min$ since the stationary distribution $\mu_\theta$ depends on the policy. When we have deterministic actions in the MDP, some states may even have probability of zero in the stationary distribution of the ensuing Markov chain.
 See previous box. One thing to note is that I don't prove convergence rates in my work, and I did not go through the proofs to verify their correctness.

To my knowledge, this is the first example of global convergence of the actor critic algorithm using neural network parametrization. It is a good extension of the actor critic sample complexity analysis given in works such as Xu et.al (2020) from a linear function approximation to a neural network approximation for the value function. Extends well established analysis of single timescale actor critic for a linear function approximation to one with a neural network approximation for the value function. 

Provides better convergence bounds than current analyses of actor critic using neural network approximations, while not having the restriction in the depth of the networks that existing results have.

The paper is well written, concise and easy to follow.
 Since a finite state space is being assumed here, the comparison to existing results  such as Wang et. al (2019) and Cayci et. al. (2022) does not seem to be valid. Both these works assume an infinite state space. Since the constant c1 is a multiple of the cardinality of the state space, an infinite state space does not seem to work for the analysis given here. 

The upper bound on the norm of the Hessian of the neural network in Liu et.al (2020) is stated as a probabilistic bound. This bound is stated as deterministic in the lemma B.1.

Assumption 2.7 while being obvious for a linear function approximation, has not been assumed in the works cited where a neural network approximation has been used such as Cai. et. al (2019) and Xu and Gu (2020). Thus the validity of the assumption has not been established for the setup being analyzed. Can the existing result be extended to an infinite state space? That is not immediately clear from the analysis done here.

As a consequence of the finite state space, what is the advantage of assuming a neural network approximation here and not a tabular form of the value function?

 I will preface my review by saying that I have little background on convergence of actor-critic methods or in analyses of deep networks -- and thus not much to say about the significance of the technical advances. 

I found that despite this lack of background, this paper was an absolute pleasure to read. The paper is very well-written, and the authors do a great job of motivating the problem and the technical approach. Each assumption is well-motivated, and the two tools -- nonlinear gradient splitting and the nonlinear small gain theorem -- are also described in a way that is easy to understand. I wish that more theory papers were written like this!

While I briefly looked through the proofs in the appendix, I unfortunately do not have the expertise to gauge correctness.
 While the mechanism of the proof was very well explained in the paper, I would have liked to see some more discussion about the significance of the result and it's implications for future work. Why is this result interesting? What does it enable? Perhaps it would be useful to spend a little more time discussing the applicability of the proposed tools and theory beyond their application to AC -- what other places may these technical tools be useful?  1. I would have loved to see a little more discussion on future directions. What are the next steps to relax? Or is it to more tightly characterize the convergence?

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  The iSEE package was developed to allow people to easily perform exploratory data analysis with data that are stored in a Bioconductor SummarizedExperiment object. A SummarizedExperiment container allows researchers to store one or more matrices of data, where the columns represent samples, and the rows represent either genomic positions or genomic features (genes, exons, transcription start sites, etc). In addition to the matrices of data, the SummarizedExperiment also contains two additional objects that describe the samples (the colData) and the rows (the rowData or rowRanges). iSEE allows users to interactively plot the underlying data from a SummarizedExperiment, and also choose subsets of the data based on either interactive selection of data in a plot, or by selecting samples or genomic regions based on the colData or rowData. The chosen subsets can then be linked to other plots in the Shiny Dashboard. This simplifies what could be a complex process, allowing both experienced R users a quick way to check over their data, and allowing less experienced R users the ability to do things that they otherwise might not have been able to do. All the underlying code generated while making interactive changes is saved and can be printed out later, in order to make the exploratory data analysis reproducible. This is an excellent feature, particularly for those who want to share observations with colleagues that may not be local.  The only negative for this package is that, being based on the Shiny framework, to allow a colleague to explore the data requires that the colleague either have R, iSEE, and all its dependencies installed, or that you have a server running all necessary packages that you can point the colleague to. This limits sharing with people who are not R savvy, but is a function of how Shiny works, rather than the iSEE package. This is a high quality package, and given the generalizability of the SummarizedExperiment package, is applicable to a whole range of different data types. Given the ease of use, self documenting features, and applicability to multiple data types, this package will likely become very popular for exploratory data analysis.

I only have minor some comments: Tutorial 2: step 10 gets the text box in the upper left of the windows, but I think it should be at other position since it says to change the y-axis of the plot. I think this happens when the user doesn't follow the instruction to click on to some button that should expand the menu with more options.  It would be nice the tour re-start from the position it was left, with an option to start over. It happened many times that I click accidentally outside the box and I had to start over.  In the cases the object doesn't have reducedDim for more than the 2 dimensions shown in the plot. I tried to use 3, and it gave an error. Maybe a more informative error would help the user to understand that there is no that information.  I am not totally sure how to use the rintrojs package to generate a tool. It would be nice a reference to some documentation on how to do it or clarification if I am not understanding this correctly.  For the features mentioned like code tracking and additional functionality, it would be nice to have a link to the vignette in the paper so the user can jump into how to get it done.  I think it would be nice to make available a docker image with all the requirements to run iSEE installed. It would promote the use of the tool a lot among bioinformaticians working with non-computational researchers.  It is nice to change the color for all the variables. I would add an example on how to change the palette for all categorical since the code would be slightly different than the one for continuous variables. It would make the user quickly using that option and avoid silly errors.  I don't know if this is possible as it is right now, but it could be an option to load a RDA/RDS file containing the SE object instead of creating an app only for that data? That would open the door to deploy the tool independent of the data. For instance, I can see a scenario where iSEE is installed in a docker container, where the user just starts the image and when opening the browser at localhost:8787, there is an option to load a file with the object.

199,Alejandro-Reyes,iSEE: Interactive SummarizedExperiment Explorer,"Data exploration is critical to the comprehension of large biological data sets generated by high-throughput assays such as sequencing. However, most existing tools for interactive visualisation are limited to specific assays or analyses. Here, we present the iSEE (Interactive SummarizedExperiment Explorer) software package, which provides a general visual interface for exploring data in a SummarizedExperiment object. iSEE is directly compatible with many existing R/Bioconductor packages for analysing high-throughput biological data, and provides useful features such as simultaneous examination of (meta)data and analysis results, dynamic linking between plots and code tracking for reproducibility. We demonstrate the utility and flexibility of iSEE by applying it to explore a range of real transcriptomics and proteomics data sets.","Approved  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.  Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  The authors implement an interactive tool, called iSEE, to perform exploratory analyses for high-throughput experiments. The tool inputs a Bioconductor core structure, the SummarizedExperiment object (coerced into a SingleCellExperiment object) and builds an interactive interphase for data exploration. iSEE provides several tools for data exploration by plotting features of an assay along with sample metadata, feature metadata, and reduced representations of the assays. Furthermore, iSEE enables users to interact with the plots and to dynamically link panels with different representations of the data. The analyses performed using iSEE are reproducible, since the code that was run through the graphic interphase can be downloaded.  Overall, the manuscript presents a very good idea and the code implementation is of great quality. iSEE will be very useful for people without programming background to perform basic analyses. I believe that the success of this tool will depend on whether the authors continue to develop it based on feature requests from users.  I don’t have major concerns. However, I do have some recommendations to increase the interest of potential users. Enable users to select more than one group of samples from the dimensionality reduction plots. Furthermore, it would be very useful to enable users to fill new columns of colData based on the interactive grouping of samples.  Enable users to retrieve an R data object if the initial input was modified during the analysis.  In the context of single-cell or large-scale analyses, it would be helpful to implement tools for differential abundance analyses and gene set enrichment analyses. For instance, one could think of an implementation where users manually define groups of cells from tSNE/PCA plots, retrieve the genes that are differentially expressed between these groups, and extract the pathways that are enriched among the differentially expressed genes.  When grouping samples manually on the tSNE/PCA plots, the violin plots of individual features (for example, genes) could be stratified based on these selections (e.g. plot one violin per group of selected points in the “Feature assay plot” panel). In the current implementation, it is only possible to colors the points within the violin plot, which makes difficult to compare distributions between groups of samples.

108,Reviewer-6Zbj,Learning to Reach Goals via Diffusion,"Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models capable of mapping random noise in high-dimensional spaces to a target manifold through iterative denoising. In this work, we present a novel perspective on goal-conditioned reinforcement learning by framing it within the context of diffusion modeling. Analogous to the diffusion process, where Gaussian noise is used to create random trajectories that walk away from the data manifold, we construct trajectories that move away from potential goal states. We then learn a goal-conditioned policy analogous to the score function. This approach, which we call Merlin, can reach predefined or novel goals from an arbitrary initial state without learning a separate value function. We consider three choices for the noise model to replace Gaussian noise in diffusion - reverse play from the buffer, reverse dynamics model, and a novel non-parametric approach. We theoretically justify our approach and validate it on offline goal-reaching tasks. Empirical results are competitive with state-of-the-art methods, which suggests this perspective on diffusion for RL is a simple, scalable, and effective direction for sequential decision-making.","The paper proposes a diffusion based method for goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning. It is assumed that a dataset of offline demonstrations is given (which also indicate a goal variable g). This dataset is then used to train a diffusion-model-based policy. The idea is to inverse-diffuse the current sample to eventually arrive at the goal point. Hence, the noising process is in state space, where the idea is that the goal state is continuously noised (generating a reversed trajectory). - The problem setting is interesting
- The figures are nice and intuitively explain the ideas presented in the paper
- The analogies to behavior cloning are interesting
- Reduction in need for denoising steps is beneficial - The introduction could be improved by making the exact problem setting more clear from the beginning
- The nearest neighbor based approach makes the assumtion that close states are connected/ can be accessd from each other, this should be discussed. This could also be evaluated by designing a more complex toy environment based on the environment in Figure 2.
- The related work description of Janner et all is not exactly correct, as it is not full trajectories that are noised but just trajectory segments
- A comparison to the related works such as \[A\] would be appreciated
- An ablation on trajectory stitching is only implicitly done (by defining different algorithms)
- A motivation for the goal-conditioned problem setting (instead of starting with just a single goal setting) would be beneficial  
 
-.

- The description of the method is rather confusing. First, it is explained that the trajectory is denoised, which would result in a denoising of states. However, in the following sections, suddenly the action is denoised (see section 4.1)
- Is the policy a diffusion model? It is mentioned that BC is performed at the end of section 5.2.
- The paper would definitely benefit from an algorithm description of the method
- It appears that the dataset extension through trajectory stitching is not performed for the baseline methods, which makes the comparison unfair
- The fact that methods based on inverse dynamics model approaches did not work weakens the method, as trajectoriy stitching has obv. downsides and likely only works in state spaces that resemble physical environments

It frames sequential decision making as the reverse process in diffusion. In this case the initial state is “noise” and the final state is the result of denoising. For a particular goal state the policy will “denoise” the initial state. An additional contribution of this work is their “trajectory stitching method”. If there are states that are nearby to one another in two different trajectories then the dataset can be augmented by concatenation of trajectory segments (making sure to relabel the goal state for the swapped trajectories). Interesting dataset augmentation technique that might improve performance on some control tasks. The trajectory stitching method is only usable if distance between two states can be defined. What if states are observed via images? Additionally what if distance between states is not indicative of their relation to one another in a sequential process. What if there are discontinuities in states?

135,Clement-Jonquet,Ontology alignment for wearable devices and bioinformatics in professional health care,"Web Ontology Language (OWL) based models and triple stores hold great potential for access to structured information. Not only are OWL-based ontologies extremely versatile and extendable, but triple stores are robust against changes to ontologies and data. The biomedical field illustrates this value insomuch as it employs vast amounts of information distributed across different models and repositories. This paper presents a case study that sought to demonstrate the real-world value of linking disease, symptom, and anatomical models with wearable devices and physical property models and repositories. Integrating these models is both necessary and problematic; necessary to provide undifferentiated access to health care professionals, problematic because although the biomedical ontologies and repositories exist, they aren't semantically aligned and their designs make alignment difficult. This case study demonstrated that manually linking multiple biomedically-related models can produce a useful tool. It also demonstrated specific issues with aligning curated ontologies, specifically the need for compatible ontology design methodologies to ease the alignment. Although this study used manual ontology mapping, it is believed that systems can be developed that can work in tandem with subject matter experts to reduce mapping effort to verification and validity checking.","The papers presents an application of semantic web approach for integrating health/medical data with wearable device information. The idea is to offer an integrated model for: device, physical property, Anatomy, Symptom and disease. The authors explain the ontologies they have used and how they have connected them. The paper has significant issues to be considered good candidate for a journal publication. Mainly, the study presented in this ‘application report’ appears not finished, with negative conclusions in terms of scalability/expansion of the approach and impact. Although the position of the study is never clear between data integration vs. data interoperability, the paper does present an integrated model for 5 ontologies: DOID, SYMP, FMA, QUDT and SSN. Such models is supposed to help to represent device related data (at least Vandrico) and answer queries such as the one given in beginning of introduction. Such a model is an interesting contribution which certainly has value and should be evaluated by the community. However, the biggest lack is that the model proposed is not really experimented/tested/used in the paper. Its impact is not demonstrated. By the end of the paper, 4 diseases (from DOID) are mentioned, but no information about the numbers of concepts/relations from other ontologies are given. The methodology for generating manually symptoms for disease is purely manual and such a task should not be given to non-medical expert. And if medical experts would be in the loop, they would know the disease-symptoms relations without having to search manually the web. In addition, as stated by the authors this approach totally prevent to be extended for more diseases and syndromes. Overall in the paper the clarification about what the authors called ‘alignment’, ‘mapping’, ‘semantic bridge’ etc. is not clear. The notion of alignment is pretty clear in the community and I am not sure I will call ‘connecting ontologies to integrate them in a common schema’ an ontology alignment. What you are doing is a good example of designing a new small schema or ontology with strong reuse of other existing ones. Which is a good practice, but it’s not ‘ontology alignment’ rather ontology reuse. Such point would have be avoided if the paper would provide a real state of the art related to: the use of wearable device and relevant ontologies for them and previous work that have proposed an integration with biomedical ontologies. This is a strong lack of the current paper. In conclusion, I will say that the current paper does not offer convincing evidence of the impact and importance of the application. The core of the contribution (i.e., the integrated model) might be useful (assuming it does not exists, what a state of the art on that aspect would have said) but the application of that model does not convince the reader of the results one can obtain by using such a model. Semantic web technologies are used at least by the fact of offering the new model as an ontology. But nothing related to semantic web data technologies is mentioned (eg., RDF etc.).

Unique subsections are used. -	Section 1: You should discuss that the query the doctor is asking in the case of diabetes II will be asked only once… then the doctor will have the knowledge that diabete => deviceX. -	Section 1 should rather concentrates on wearable device rather than on the impact of ontologies and semantic web technologies. The audience of the SWJ will know this. -	Beginning of section 2 is unclear. Your goals are described with words that haven’t been clarify to the reader yet. Maybe come back on this in conclusion. -	If you assume a device is always something that measure a property, then say it explicitly. -	You could give examples in beginning of section 2 to illustrate your speech. -	Section 3.1: explain what you mean by semantic bridge. If your contribution is a “semantic bridge ontology” define this introduction, give it a name and refer to it by its name. -	Use namespace abbreviation in your figure, this will help figuring out what is existing, what is yours. Provide your own namespace. -	You need to tell us more about Vandrico data source. Size, format, importance in the field, why this one, etc. -	Section 4 is not a relevant state of the art for your application. This section must allow to answer what have been done in the semantic web for medical and wearable device integration?

The key challenge of 3D NCD is that learned features by known class recognition are heavily biased and hinder generalization to novel classes. Since geometric parts are more generalizable across different classes, we propose to decompose novel into known parts, coined DNIK, to mitigate the above problems. DNIK learns a part concept bank encoding rich part geometric patterns from known classes so that novel 3D shapes can be represented as part concept compositions to facilitate cross-category generalization.

Code and data will be released.","- This paper proposes a novel part-based algorithm for 3D novel class discovery (NCD). Authors propose Decompose Novel Into Known parts (DNIK) that leverages knowledge about parts of known objects to discover novel classes.
- Authors identify that the main problem with learning 3D features for object discovery is that the features are heavily biased towards the known classes. This work shows that this can be prevented by using the well known part-based modeling approach. 
- DNIK is trained to learn a part concept bank that can be used to compose different known and novel objects. Three different regularizations are proposed to prevent the collapse of this part bank.
- Extensive experiments show the deficiencies of existing 2D NCD literature and the effectiveness of DNIK to overcome these issues. - This paper builds on an age old, part-based models in visual recognition and shows impressive improvements over single holistic representations currently in use in the 2D category discovery methods. As shown in the experiments this has significant merits for identifying and grouping new classes. 
- The paper writing was smooth and was very easy to follow. An experienced engineer would be able to reproduce the work with the given details.
- Authors support all the claims made in the paper with experiments on real world datasets or on toy problems. Sec 3.1 and Fig. 4.a were particularly interesting to understand what the authors were trying to convey.
- The effectiveness of the method was shown with the impressive experimental results. - While the problem tackled by the authors is relevant and important, the setup adopted by the authors is outdated. Generalized category discovery, as done in \[1\]\[2\] is a more realistic setting and it is not clear why the current method is not suited for this setup or the authors advice against it? It is my strong suggestion to the authors to answer this question and compare with the relevant work (cited below) to justify this work among existing literature.
- The toy example in Sec. 3.1 is not fair for the following reason. In L86, the setup states that the classes in known and unknown sets share some similarities, but in the example authors choose {table, sofa, stool} as known and {chair, bench, bathtub, plant} as unknown objects. In this case, bathtub and plant do not share any commonalities with the known objects. It looks like the authors intentionally exaggerate the problem to make their point. While this is acceptable, it is not clear how much of a serious issue is the ""overfitting to the known classes"" problem. 
- Author propose to use supervised contrastive loss to learn more parts from the known shapes. The motivation and explanation doesn't justify why this would be the case. In L204 authors pool the features along the last dimension which basically is a ""shape"" feature as opposed to a ""part"" feature. It is not clear how the contrastive loss helps learn more part features when the loss is being applied on the ""shape"" features.
- Table 4 demonstrates the performance improvement for each of the proposed components but experiments to demonstrate that show that the regularizations on the part features actually operate as the authors claim is missing. What happens when diversity loss is missing? Do all the part features in the bank collapse to fewer representations? This can be quantified by cosine similarity between the part features. Similar analysis on the remaining two regularization terms is warranted.

52,Reviewer-zZT9,Decompose Novel into Known: Part Concept Learning For 3D Novel Class Discovery,"In this work, we address 3D novel class discovery (NCD) that discovers novel classes from an unlabeled dataset by leveraging the knowledge of disjoint known classes. The key challenge of 3D NCD is that learned features by known class recognition are heavily biased and hinder generalization to novel classes. Since geometric parts are more generalizable across different classes, we propose to decompose novel into known parts, coined DNIK, to mitigate the above problems. DNIK learns a part concept bank encoding rich part geometric patterns from known classes so that novel 3D shapes can be represented as part concept compositions to facilitate cross-category generalization. Moreover, we formulate three constraints on part concepts to ensure diverse part concepts without collapsing. A part relation encoding module (PRE) is also developed to leverage part-wise spatial relations for better recognition. We construct three 3D NCD tasks for evaluation and extensive experiments show that our method achieves significantly superior results than SOTA baselines (+11.7%, +14.1%, and +16.3% improvements on average for three tasks, respectively). Code and data will be released.","This paper addresses the problem of 3D NCD (novel class discovery). The objective is to discover novel classes by leveraging information learned from the known classes. This paper proposes a novel framework, DNIK, for 3D novel class discovery (3D NCD) by leveraging part concepts and part-wise relations learned from known classes to reinforce the recognition of novel shapes. The framework consists of a learnable part concept bank, a local geometric aggregation module, a part relation encoding module, and three constraints to facilitate effective part concept learning.  (1) The proposed part concept bank and part relation encoding module can effectively bridge the gaps between known and novel shapes and mitigate feature bias.

(2) The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms all baselines consistently and significantly on all metrics. 

(3) The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. (1) The unseen class number is assumed to be known, which makes the method less practical.

(2) The effectiveness of the proposed PRE module is not well demonstrated. The performance is not shown by using only the part position feature from the PRE. Therefore, it is not clear about the individual role of PCB and PRE. It would be good to at least ablate the effectiveness that only uses PRE in Table 4.

(3) The study of NCD has been extended to consider the case where the unlabelled data contains objects from seen and unseen classes \[A\]. It is more convincing to also show results under this more general and practical case.

(4) Each part in Part Set Q has the same number of points, that is, K neighbors, which may be dataset dependent and affected by the scale of the objects, while a fixed value of K=64 is selected in the paper. This is unlikely to generalize well to other datasets and objects of different scales. It would be good to show how the method works on instances from the same categories but of different scales. More investigation on this is expected.

 (1) How to ensure the features from PRE include the position relationship of each part? The feature extraction by PRE seems like a process through a black box.
(2) How are the Nq parts like in the initial point cloud? How different/similar are they? The initialization may also heavily affect the results. e.g., if the initial parts are too similar, they are unlikely to be well separated in the end. However, in the beginning, we have little (or no) control over this.

Additionally, the paper empirically validates the theoretical results by examining the sample complexity of the proposed hierarchical algorithm on several toy grid-world tasks. I commend the authors for addressing an important theoretical problem in the field of HRL and deriving a lower bound to quantify the sample complexity of goal-conditioned HRL. One significant aspect that the paper lacks is a thorough theoretical analysis regarding the selection of sub-goal spaces in continuous environments or sets in discrete environments. Q1. The selection of the sub-goal space plays a vital role in the efficiency of the HRL algorithm, as different choices of sub-goal spaces can result in varying sample efficiencies, such as in HIRO \[1\], HRAC \[2\], HIGL \[3\], and others \[4\]. Unfortunately, in Theorem 3.1, the authors do not analyze the impact of different sub-goal spaces on the sample efficiency of HRL. Therefore, I find the theoretical results to be trivial.

The paper also proposes a novel hierarchical Q-learning algorithm that exploits goal-based hierarchical decomposition of an MDP into a high-level and a low-level sub-MDPs and jointly learns their policies. The authors evaluate hierarchical policies for different decompositions on original MDPs to validate when decomposition provides benefits and whether it aligns with the derived bound. 

The paper is well motivated and clearly written. The ideas of the paper to quantify benefits of hierarchical decomposition are novel. The derived theoretical guarantees on the lower bound are sound. I suggest clarifying that the derived bounds only apply to tabular setting of RL i.e. discrete state space problems in the Introduction. The theoretical findings are  backed by empirical results on maze environments of different sizes with convincing insights. The empirical evaluation would benefit from diversification of domains and tasks not restricted to navigation, and an investigation of bounds when using bad and good decompositions for the same environment.  (I) The paper provides strong theoretical guarantees on the lower bound of the number of episodes given a decomposition needed to learn an epsilon-accurate hierarchical policy, which also serves as a lower bound to learn an epsilon-accurate optimal policy. 

(II) The paper also identifies properties relating to state and temporal abstractions and the size of the high-level action space from the derived bound that can improve sample efficiency.
 (I) The assumptions regarding the scope of the derived bounds restricted to a tabular setting need to be clarified in the Introduction. 

(II) All experiments are on maze environments of different sizes. While the current analysis is convincing for navigation tasks, it will be interesting to see if the benefits of decomposition and the derived bounds align for more diverse domains and tasks that not restricted to just navigation e.g. officeworld \[2\], taxiworld \[3\] etc.

(III) It is not clear how the bounds will identify when a decomposition is bad enough and would degrade the performance compared to non-hierarchical algorithms. 

Minor errors:
(I) Line 48: proposes -> propose (I) How are the ideas of the Stationary Hierarchical Q-learning to overcome non-stationarity of the high-level policy related to the ideas in \[1\]? 

(II) Can you elaborate what it means to separate the original state space evenly between the two level of hierarchy? 

(III) Does the method apply only to dense reward functions?

(IV) Would the bounds identify when a decomposition for an environment would degrade performance of the proposed algorithm compared to Qlearning?

Formulates HRL as a two-level problem, where the upper level passes actions to the lower level policy. The work proves a lower bound on the complexity of the HRL formulation which pivotally scales according to the size of the high level action space and the reusability of the low level space. A new algorithm is introduced which identifies the need for a consistent low level action space, and this method is asssessed in four-room gridworld domains.  This work provides a clean proof with a highly understandable sketch and a strong intuition. Together, this provides an extremely clear and easy-to-read description of the sample complexity of HRL In addition, the theory provides some clear insights into how to understand other HRL work.

This work provides a simple idea applied to the existing framework of HRL in the description of the high-level training based on low-level performance. It also seems like adding the intuition of the shared upper-level complexity term would be useful for keeping the size of the upper policy action space small (by somehow limiting the goals), which is empirically verified in other HRL work.
 Figure 1 is difficult to comprehend, somehow managing to be simultaneously overly simple (this is a basic construction of hierarchical RL) and overly complicated (what is the intuition for the equations on the right-hand side?

This work contrasts against the Options framework in the first paragraph of the background, without specific Ying what the options framework is. As a framework itself, the options framework also makes no assumptions about prior knowledge, no prevents from state abstraction, both statements made about the framework. 

This work spends much of the earlier part justifying the context of the goal-based hierarchy, but it appears that other than the state-based complexity term, there is no strict requirement that the hierarchy be goal based as opposed to simply parameter based. As long as there exists a measure of the performance of the lower-level policy, it seems like the same reasoning would apply. 

The empirical results are somewhat lacking. In particular, while the proof should apply generally to HRL contexts, the work only empirically verifies in maze environments, and maze environments which are constructed to amplify the advantages of the upper-level policy. A different kind of environment such as a mountain car or multiple inverted pendulum would have been interesting, notwithstanding an environment that requires a deep RL method.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  The study protocol is written well. However, authors need to mention clearly how this protocol is different from the one published in 2018. This has been referred as: Neogi S, Negandhi H, Sharma J, et al.: Diagnostic efficacy of digital hemoglobinometer (TrueHb), HemoCue and non invasive devices for screening patients for anemia in the field settings-a proposal. Indian J Comm Health. 2018; 30(Supp): 86–81. Beside comparing three devices in previously published protocol, what other generic features are included in this protocol. Currently, to me, its just an updated version of previously published protocol and thus should not be indexed again. Instead authors should have mentioned what progress they have made since publishing their previous protocol and how many individuals have been screened until now. In the methods section, canvassing of EQ-5D questionnaire is mentioned but in cost-effectiveness analysis this information has not been used. It is not clear to me why this instrument is required (to measure changes in HRQoL or QALYs between individuals screened by invasive and non-invasive methods, which doesn't make any sense to me when individuals who are screened are not going to be followed-up). More importantly, the very generic concept of Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) can't be applied here due to absence of follow-ups (i.e. no data is collected at two points in time). Authors can only compare cost per correctly detected screening outcome between four types of method/equipment instead of computing ICER. Authors have not included details of costing information for enhanced training to field workers/ANMs to be used for various screening equipment in the clinical/community setting. Finally, there is a huge difference in purchase prices between equipment and how these will be used in cost-effectiveness analysis is not clear to me. For instance within invasive method, the cost of Tru Hb equipment is 8-10 times higher than HemoCue. And if one is just comparing the purchase cost per correctly detected screening outcome within invasive method would be a terrible blunder. Therefore, one needs to account for the case loads as well as the mixed-use for varied purposes for an equipment during its lifetime or becoming obsolete.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  The authors reiterate the public health significance of anaemia in LMICs and the complexities of the modalities available for haemoglobin measurement in various clinical settings, from the capital-intensive, technically demanding haematology analyzers to hand-held, point-of-care testing devices. The cost-effective determination of anaemia remains pertinent and relevant especially in LMIC settings with high prevalence of anaemia and this, they have demonstrated in their introductory comments. The authors have sought to compare the cost effectiveness of available technology for screening of anaemia in the field. The rationale aligns with clinical and policy needs for a quick, accurate, reliable and cost-effective method for the detection of anaemia which is highly prevalent in the study population and this is borne out in the primary objective of this study. The measurement of HRQoL using EQ-5D tool however, may be reflective of the underlying aetiology of the anaemia detected rather than the nature of the technology (invasive and/or non-invasive devices) utilized in the detection of anaemia. Its determination as a secondary objective may not be relevant to this particular study. The strategy for analysis of cost does not fall under the reviewer’s area of expertise but their exploration of the factors contributing to the evaluation of cost-effectiveness and factors impacting on end-user utilization is quite comprehensive. However, the opening statement for the study design denotes an evaluation of diagnostic accuracy of testing methodology which is not reflective of the title and main text. It is also unclear if the authors wish to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness or otherwise of the gold standard/reference test (auto-analyzer) against the index invasive and non-invasive test techniques or if the latter are being compared to each other.

22,Reviewer-rgZH,CO2: Efficient Distributed Training with Full Communication-Computation Overlap,"The fundamental success of large language models hinges upon the efficacious implementation of large-scale distributed training techniques. Nevertheless, building a vast, high-performance cluster featuring high-speed communication interconnectivity is prohibitively costly, and accessible only to prominent entities. In this work, we aim to lower this barrier and democratize large-scale training with limited bandwidth clusters. We propose a new approach called CO2 that introduces local-updating and asynchronous communication to the distributed data-parallel training, thereby facilitating the full overlap of COmmunication with COmputation. CO2 is able to attain a high scalability even on extensive multi-node clusters constrained by very limited communication bandwidth. We further propose the staleness gap penalty and outer momentum clipping techniques together with CO2 to bolster its convergence and training stability. Besides, CO2 exhibits seamless integration with well-established ZeRO-series optimizers which mitigate memory consumption of model states with large model training. We also provide a mathematical proof of convergence, accompanied by the establishment of a stringent upper bound. Furthermore, we validate our findings through an extensive set of practical experiments encompassing a wide range of tasks in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. These experiments serve to demonstrate the capabilities of CO2 in terms of convergence, generalization, and scalability when deployed across configurations comprising up to 128 A100 GPUs. The outcomes emphasize the outstanding capacity of CO2 to hugely improve scalability, no matter on clusters with 800Gbps RDMA or 80Gbps TCP/IP inter-node connections.","The paper proposes an approach called CO2 to improve throughput of distributed model training by overlapping computation and communication. Building on prior work that perform multiple training iterations with local updates before each global model synchronization, CO2 enables further throughput improvement by making the global synchronization asynchronous and overlapped with the next round of local updates. CO2 proposes two techniques for addressing the convergence issues of the asynchrony: (i) staleness penalty gap, and (ii) outer momentum clipping. The paper presents theoretical analyses of the convergence guarantees of these two techniques. The evaluation results show that CO2 can achieve convergence results comparable to baselines that are fully synchronous (e.g, Adam) and better than those using local updates (e.g, LocalSGD). The experimental results also show the throughput and scalability of CO2 are better than Adam. The paper is tackling an important problem since communication is a major bottleneck for scaling model sizes and training hardware, and so approaches for reducing communication overheads are very relevant to the community. 

The idea of overlapping communication with computation is reasonable given the cost-effectiveness. I also liked the fact that the paper attempts to quantify and fix the resulting staleness update problem. 

The evaluation considers a diverse and important set of workloads and hardware environments, which helps to understand the generality of CO2. I observe some critical problems in the draft that raise the question of whether CO2 can simultaneously achieve good convergence and high throughput. 

1. The convergence and throughput trade-off of inner loop step count ($\tau$) is not clearly reported in evaluation. In particular, the convergence results in Tables 1 & 2 should include the corresponding $\tau$ and throughput. I was unable to determine whether the good convergence results are achieved with $\tau$ that also provides throughput benefits. 

2. The paper is silent on the memory overheads of CO2 relative to baselines, even though Algorithm 2 suggests that multiple copies of the model is required to support asynchronous communication. 

3. Equation 3 assumes learning rate decay in the inner loop which is not true for learning rate schedules, such as cyclic, which involve learning rate increases. 

4. It is unclear to me whether CO2 can achieve expected throughput benefits in scenarios with parallelism techniques (e.g., tensor slicing, sequence parallelism, and zero stage 3) that introduce communication to forward/backward passes. It seems these (synchronous) communication operations would interfere with the overlapped communication and hurt overall throughput. Evaluating such scenarios could help to better understand the generality of CO2.

CO2 leverages local SGD, performing a fixed (tunable) number of local iterations while allreduces perform synchronization in the background, allowing communication to almost always be hidden. To ensure good convergence, CO2 computes a staleness gap metric and uses this to scale updates, as well as a clipping mechanism to limit the variance of updates. A convergence bound is proven and experiments on a variety of network architectures and datasets show convergence matches that of standard SGD and other communication-avoiding algorithms; in the low-bandwidth regime, CO2 additionally offers significantly improved performance and scalability. 1. This paper is addressing an important situation: communication-bound training workloads. This can occur due to both large models and slower interconnects. I appreciate that the paper specifically and clearly calls out lower-bandwidth networks as an area it is focused on. While the idea is relatively straightforward, it includes some details to get it to work well in practice.
2. The paper adequately specifies its proposed algorithm and includes some theoretical justification to support its claims.
3. There are extensive experiments on a variety of models, including relatively large ones, demonstrating roughly equivalent convergence curves, indicating that the method does not compromise learning.
4. Scalability studies are also conducted, showing slightly improved performance on high-bandwidth networks and significantly improved performance on low-bandwidth networks relative to a standard allreduce implementation. 1. I think the claims of ""perfect 100% scalability"" are a bit oversold. This relies on appropriately selecting $\tau$, the number of local steps between global communications; it seems clear that if you can arbitrarily set the amount of computation done to hide communication, you can easily hide it. (Though I wish to be clear that the paper is clear that you can't make $\tau$ arbitrarily high and still achieve good convergence.) This also neglects other aspects of training which may limit scalability (e.g., I/O for data ingestion).
2. The paper does not provide guidance on selecting an appropriate $\tau$, and in its experiments searches over a small set of potential values. This seems like a challenging parameter to tune in practice, as it could significantly increase hyperparameter tuning costs.
3. It is not clear to me how the paper improves upon existing communication-efficient works which try to tune the communication frequency to achieve both good learning and runtime performance. In particular, works like Wang & Joshi, ""Adaptive Communication Strategies to Achieve the Best Error-Runtime Trade-off in Local-Update SGD"", or Haddadpour et al., ""Local SGD with Periodic Averaging: Tighter Analysis and Adaptive Synchronization"", seem like relevant points of comparison.
4. The paper lacks implementation details. Specifically, it does not specify how the asynchronous allreduce is implemented (e.g., is it using a NCCL allreduce on a separate CUDA stream?). It is also not clear whether the asynchronous allreduce is operating on a separate weight/gradient buffer from the one being used for computation; or what the memory overheads of the method are.
5. While I appreciate that the experiments were run multiple times (Section 4.1), the results do not include any measure of variance. This makes it hard to understand whether CO2 amplifies the variance between runs and how much methods actually differ.
6. Scalability is only evaluated on one model. I would be interested to see how models other than the TransNormer-LLM scale; in my experience, smaller models tend to benefit less from communication optimizations as they are already often able to hide most communication.
7. The scaling study in Section 4.3 does not include any comparisons with other communication-efficient methods. Given that SlowMo demonstrates very similar convergence curves, it seems prudent to see whether CO2 offers better scalabiltiy.
8. From a performance perspective, the paper is missing a detailed analysis substantiating its claims. In particular, the communication/computation overlap achieved is never actually measured. 1. I think the paper would be stronger if the claims of ""perfect 100% scalability"" were toned down and better contextualized. (See above for some details.)
2. How should $\tau$ be selected? Is hyperparameter tuning the only way to do so?
3. How does the paper improve upon prior works which tune the communication frequency (see above for some references)? Could these approaches be used to tune $\tau$ automatically?
4. Please add implementation details and a discussion of memory overheads. I think memory may be especially relevant for larger models such as LLMs.
5. Please add the observed variance to the accuracy results. It would also be good to include error bars in the scaling performance results.
6. How do other models considered in the paper (e.g., ResNets or ViTs) scale?
7. How do other communication-efficient (e.g., SlowMo) methods scale on the fast and slow network?
8. How much communication/computation overlap is actually achieved by CO2, particularly at scale?
9. A more minor point: The paper refers to gradient bucketing as a way to overlap communication and computation (e.g., in Section 1). I think this is not quite correct; rather, gradient bucketing is a latency/bandwidth tradeoff (performing fewer allreduces on larger buffers). While this can be more efficient, and consequently improve communication/computation overlap, it does not itself enable overlap.

Post-rebuttal update: after reading authors' responses and other reviews, I decided to keep my weakly positive score unchanged and increase the confidence of my review. I think that the contributions of the study are solid and I am in favor of accepting the submission, but I am not fully sure that the work will have significant impact on the field in light of prior closely related publications. * Overall, the proposed method is conceptually simple yet shows promising results.
* The paper has a broad range of experiments, covering 5 setups with models that are widely used in practice.
* Authors conduct a detailed ablation study for the components of CO2, as well as measure its scalability in different environments. * While I am not an expert in distributed optimization, to my understanding, similar methods allowing full overlap of communication and computation have been proposed previously. See, for example, \[1\] from the related work section: on page 17, they state that ""as long as the number of local updates τ is large enough, the communication can be fully overlapped with the local computation."" This appears to be quite close to the primary contribution of this work, therefore I believe that the submission needs to describe the key distinctions from prior work in more detail.
* I think that the experimental setup description could benefit from more details. For example, while the authors mention that their hyperparameters were tuned ""to find the optimal balance between efficiency and performance"", we do not see neither the exact values of $\tau$ for each experiment nor the exact description of the tuning procedure. Also, authors mention that they leverage ZeRO for TransNormer experiments, but do not state the exact type of the optimizer within that family.
* Lastly, the majority of model sizes used in this work have quite small parameter counts (fewer than 1B), and therefore it is a bit surprising to see communication as the bottleneck for training even on 80Gbps networks. I think that it would be beneficial to provide more detailed breakdowns of computation and communication times (for example, the time to process 1 microbatch and 1 batch of data, as well as the time to exchange parameters) in each setting to demonstrate the necessity of large $\tau$.

CountMin and CountSketch are the most popular algorithms for this task. With the addition of learning augmentation, an algorithm is given access to a learned prediction, in this case the prediction of the heavy hitters. This paper focuses on the stream being from a Zipfian distribution, which are well-studied, well-motivated distributions with heavy tails.

In the learning-augmented algorithm, if an element is predicted to be heavy, it is given a unique bucket so that a more accurate frequency can be computed for it. If it isn’t predicted to be heavy, it is simply input into a sketching  algorithm. They prove bounds on the weighted error of algorithms, including,  CountSketch, CountMin, and a novel algorithm. For CountSketch and CountMin, the paper gives a tight analysis. The new algorithm is studied both with and without predictions, though predictions give the largest advantage in low space settings. 

Experiments justify the theory is predictive of performance.  - Learning-augmented frequency estimation is itself a very nice question, I was looking forward to reading this paper in my pile. 
- The algorithm is clean, straight-forward. I believe the results are correct. 
- The paper is grammatically well-written.

 - I am confused about the prediction model. Normally, in learning-augmented algorithms, we measure an algorithm’s performance based on the error in the prediction. Here, as far as I could tell, all of the theoretical results only held when one assumed the predicted heavy hitters were correct. I expected to see some trade-off between the quality of prediction and the weighted error bounds. The experiments briefly mentioned that the prediction quality might be poor, thus leading to worse empirical performance (as expected), but there was no theory discussing the robustness of the predictions. Robustness in the prediction error is what differentiates learning-augmented algorithm from all these other BWCA frameworks (data-driven algorithms, algorithms with advice, etc). 
Perhaps because of the heavy tail distribution assumptions, it’s reasonable to assume that one learns the heavy hitters perfectly? Or can you offer another explanation for this choice in the model?

- This paper does not clearly lay out its improvements on prior work. I would like to see a lot more comparison to the most relevant previous work \[Hsu et al. 2019\].

==================
* This work follows (Hsu Indyk Katabi Vakilian 2019) in trying to improve the performance of hashing-based frequency estimation algorithms (such as Count-Min, CountSketch) by making use of ""advice"" in the form of a learning model's predictions which classify the input elements as ""heavy-hitters"" or otherwise based on the input distribution.
* Just as (HIKV2019), the theoretical analysis assumes a Zipfian (heavy-tail) property for the data distribution, and they provide guarantees for the expected weighted estimation error $\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i \cdot |f_i - \hat{f}_i|$.
* They improve on the (HIKV2019) analysis of Count-Min and Learned-Count-Min algorithms to get tight bounds on the expected estimation error when there are multiple hash functions ($k \geq 2$).
 * They also provide tight bounds for the expected estimation error of CountSketch, with and without learning.
* Finally, they propose a better frequency estimation algorithm --- both plain (Algorithm 1&2) and learning-augmented (Algorithm 3&4) --- and prove bounds on the expected estimation error in both cases, showing that the learning-augmented algorithm outperforms both Plain-CS and Learned-CS in all regimes, whereas the plain (no-learning) algorithm outperforms the Plain-CS algorithm in the low-space regime ($B = {\rm polylog}(n)$).
* They also propose a parsimonious variant of the algorithm (limited number of queries) and do an experimental evaluation. 
* The problem setting is already studied in the literature and thus the improvements shown in this work are clearer. The Zipfian (heavy-tail) property for the data distribution is known to hold for many real world datasets (if approximately).
* This work provides tight bounds for the expected estimation error of CountSketch and CountMin, both with and without learning. In the case of CountMin, it improves upon the existing bounds from (HIKV2019).
* The proposed ""better frequency estimation algorithm"" provides tangible improvements over CS and CM, both wiith and without learning-augmentation.
* They also consider a variation of the algorithm with worst-case guarantees, even when the data distribution is not Zipfian, and the variant nicely generalises from the Zipfian case.
* The work includes the implementation of the algorithms and experimental evaluation.
* A reasonable level of proof-sketches are provided in the main paper. * The experiments should ideally have also considered the worst-case variant of the algorithm (Algorithm 6 in the supplementary) in both the Zipfian and non-Zipfian cases.

Furthermore they also introduce a parsimonious version of their algorithm that avoids consulting the potentially much slower machine learned model for each item of the stream using Poisson sampling to provably invoke it a small number of times only. Several experiments with two real world and synthetic data sets support the claims, albeit the implemented algorithm is much simpler than the one analyzed and a simple modification of the classic CountSketch also yields substantial improvements. 1) Problem and techniques studied are extremely well motivated and widely used.

Section 3.2 proposes a theoretical construction based on the Alon-Matias-Szegedy sketch to adaptively tune and set the threshold, nevertheless this variant is not evaluated in the experiments either. It would be good to evaluate a hyper-parameter free variant that works (well) on any data out of the box or explicitly leave it as future work. Alg 1: What's median of 4?

The idea here is to align four modalities in a shared feature space first, and then learn to generate one or more modalities based on the shared feature space. This design enables many combinations of modalities despite the lack of training datasets. Since the feature space is shared, it also flexible to extend to other modalities. * The idea of any-to-any generation is interesting, and it enables many different tasks in one model.
* The framework is flexible and customizable to many other potential modalities, such as semantic maps, heat map, depth map and so on.
* The performance of the proposed method achieves comparable or better results than previous SOTA methods.
 * The method part is not clear. The relation among image diffusion model, video diffusion model, vision encoder and vision unet is confusing. Since 4 diffusion models are introduced and only 3 types of encoders and unet are shown in Figure 2, It s not clear whether image and video models share the parameters or not.
* The evaluation of Table 3 is not sufficient. Only the text-video faithfulness (CLIPSIM) is evaluated, while the video quality (FVD) is not evaluated.
* The proposed framework enables many different tasks. However, it does not outperform previous SOTA methods in many tasks, such as text-to-video generation, text-to-image generation, image captioning and video captioning.
 * From Table 8, using both text and audio as input achieves higher FID compared to using each single modality as input. Could you explain why model achieves worse performance with more information as input?
* From table 2 and table 3, CoDi does not outperform previous SOTA results. Do you think a model that can do all tasks need to sacrifice its performance on each specific task?

* In Sec 3.3, image diffusion model and video diffusion model are introduced separately. However, in Figure 2, only vision UNet and Vision Encoder are shown. Does it mean image diffusion model share parameters with video diffusion model during training?

We provide a theoretical analysis based on a PAC-Bayes bound which guarantees that for such a labeling we obtain low negative log-likelihood and high ensemble diversity on testing samples. Empirically, through detailed experiments, we find that for low to moderately-sized training sets, $\nu$-ensembles are more diverse and provide better calibration than standard ensembles, sometimes significantly.","The paper proposes a very neat method for improving the diversity of deep ensembles: It assigns random labels to a set of unlabelled data and lets each ensemble component fit different random labels such that these ensemble components can be diverse. The paper further provides theoretical guarantees for the resulting ensembles' behavior on test samples. The empirical results further show that the method acquires significantly better calibration on small training dataset regime, without sacrificing accuracy. Importantly, the method only introduces little extra training overhead while outperforming baseline approaches that are way more complicated. Overall, I think the proposed idea is novel, interesting, easy-to-use, and could be of great impact. - The proposed method is easy! It is much easier and efficient to implement than other methods for enhancing ensemble diversity, such as Stein-based methods.

- The proposed method comes with theoretical guarantees: Although the method sounds like some heuristic, the author provides PAC-Bayes bounds for its performance on test data.

- The empirical performance improvement is significant: The results show that the proposed method improves the calibration error to a great extent for both in-distribution test data and out-of-distribution data (i.e. corrupted data), without hurting the accuracy. - The method ""Sample y randomly without replacement"", however, when the number of ensemble is larger than the number of classes, it is unclear to me how the method should be applied.

- Since the method assumes having access to a validation dataset, a baseline worth considering would be temperature scaling.

- The presentation of the results can be improved: There is no legend for the lines in Figure. 2; The usage of bold font is not consistent and confusing in Table. 1 Why the method becomes less effective when we have access to more data?

If I understand correctly, the method assigns random labels to **in-distribution** data, this sounds weird to me, as it implies that the ensemble would have high uncertainty on these in-distribution samples. I think one can also consider introducing OOD samples into training and assigning random labels to them for each ensemble member.",345,0,0,0.7883,0.0617635659,0.9469445348,47,33.8655,0.1932,iclr,0.01,3,4,3,3,factual,3,4,65,neutral,4,neutral,3,moderate,4,4,4,4,partially factual,5,5,85,polite,5,positive,5,moderate,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,factual,4.0,4.0,80.0,polite,5.0,positive,5.0,none,3,4,4,3,factual,4,4,80,polite,5,positive,4,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,3,85,polite,5,positive,4,low

In particular, they propose the counterintuitive idea of randomly labelling the unlabelled dataset (distinctly for each ensemble member) and training the deep ensemble on the joint supervised and randomly labelled data. The randomly labelled data promotes ensemble diversity. A PAC bound which relates generalisation performance to ensemble diversity is derived while the diversity of the ensemble is demonstrated to be related to the ensemble size. Experiments on various slices of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that while the method does not improve accuracy relative to standard ensembles, there are substantial gains on calibration. Calibration does not improve consistently over more complicated/expensive diversity promoting ensemble methods. - The paper is very well written and clear.
- The idea for the method, of using randomly labelled unsupervised data to promote ensemble diversity is simple, cheap and easy to implement and in so far as promoting diversity makes sense.
- Some theoretical results are presented in which the ensemble diversity is related via a PAC bound to the generalization performance (I have some other comments on these results below).
- The experimental results are convincing that at least in the small data regime with relatively little unsupervised data the calibration relative to standard ensembles is significantly improved. Please see my questions in the section below for potential weaknesses that can be addressed through further experiments.

- The method is targeted solely at the small data regime, gains in calibration go to zero as the amount of labelled data increases.
- The method introduces a new $\beta$ hyperparameter which must be tuned.
- The experiments are presented without error bars and it is unclear if they come from a single run or are averaged over multiple seeds, standard practice, especially when considering the relative small datasets considered in this paper is to run experiments with multiple random seeds and present averages and standard deviations of the metrics of interest (or better yet other forms of statistical test of the significance of the results).
- Experiments are conducted on small slices of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, while performance in the large data regime is alluded to in the paper, an experimental evaluation of this setting (for example ImageNet is fairly standard in the ensemble literature) would be much appreciated.
- From equation 3, it seems to be the case that as the number of classes (c) increases the gains in ensemble diversity go to zero, so the method is both likely to give no gains in the large data and large number of classes regime.
- The primary theoretical motivation for the method is equation 1, which is a PAC bound on the generalization performance, it is difficult to get a sense of how tight this bound is and to what extent there is a competition between the various terms in the bound.

Small things (didn't effect rating):
- Typo: ""coincides we standard weight decay"" -> ""coincides with standard weight decay""
- It took me a while when reading the paper printed out to realise that there are two colours plotted in the left hand side of Figure 2 - as the orange is almost fully hidden by the red, making this clear in the figure or caption would be helpful to readers. - While the experimental results do not show big drops in accuracy, I am quite concerned that given vastly more unlabelled data the method would lead to overfitting the random labels and thereby harm test set accuracy (as is a well known phenomenon in the noisy label literature). More formally one could imagine that vast amounts of unlabelled data would promote the diversity term in the RHS of equation 1, but I given results in the noisy labels literature, I would find it hard to believe that this would not come at a corresponding cost in the first term on the RHS of equation 1. Could the authors please comment on this concern? Experimentally, I would be interested in seeing an experiment on ImageNet, for example, where the labelled set is of size 50k and the unlabelled set is 950k examples, a standard resnet50 or similar capacity model is used with 4 ensemble members (as per other papers in the literature) and a comparison to standard ensembles in terms of accuracy and calibration is given. This is a significant concern for me, as usually with methods that make use of an unsupervised dataset, the expectation is that as the unlabelled dataset grows, the gains from using it grow to. I fear this will not be the case for this method, which would limit the method to the small dataset, small number of classes and small unlabelled dataset regime. I recognise that the $\beta$ hyperparameter can to a certain extent control this trade-off, so if further experiments are conducted to address this concern, please report the results over the $\beta$ hyperparameter range.",835,0,0,0.7756000000000001,0.0024741462,0.9451873302,47,28.0723,0.5162,iclr,0.0,5,5,5,5,factual,4,5,95,polite,5,positive,5,moderate,5,5,5,5,factual,5,5,95,polite,5,neutral,5,low,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,factual,4.0,4.0,80.0,polite,5.0,positive,5.0,none,4,4,4,4,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low,3,4,4,4,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low

The use of unlabeled data to improve calibration error of deep ensembles has not been explored much before as most of the works have focused on joint training approaches which can be memory and computationally expensive.
- The paper is overall well written and easy to understand. 
- The paper presents supports their method with both theoretical and experiments. - One major weakness of the paper is that their method only improves calibration error not accuracy but they have not compared to any other calibration technique like temperature sampling. 
- The other issue is that the method appears very similar to the Agree to disagree work mentioned in the paper where they also use unlabeled data to maximize diversity and the idea seem incremental. Can the authors please explain in detail how exactly Agree to disagree maximizes diversity on the unlabeled set?
- Another limitation is that this method only improves calibration in the small data regime. 
- Another limitation is that there are only two datasets used in the paper - CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. It would be nice to have additional datasets. - The paper says that the labels for unlabeled data points are chosen without replacement. What happens if we sample with replacement? One should expect the same empirical results to hold but maybe the theoretical argument will not hold?
- I understand the text written at bottom of the Figure 1 but I don’t understand the figure. What are the 3 columns in the figure?
- One part that is not clear to me is when we are forcing the models to make random predictions on unlabeled data which is from the same distribution, why we are not hurting the accuracy or the cross entropy loss of the model? When training data is small and unlabeled data set is bigger, can the authors share their regularization parameters and if they had to give small weights on the regularization term?

Given triples $(i,j,t)$, each representing a time-stamped ($t$) interaction between two entities ($i,j$), our procedure returns a continuous-time trajectory for each node, representing its behaviour over time. The framework consists of three stages: estimating pairwise intensity functions, e.g. via kernel smoothing; learning a projection which minimises a notion of intensity reconstruction error; and constructing evolving node representations via the learned projection. The trajectories satisfy two properties, known as structural and temporal coherence, which we see as fundamental for reliable inference. Moreoever, we develop estimation theory providing tight control on the error of any estimated trajectory, indicating that the representations could even be used in quite noise-sensitive follow-on analyses.

More precisely, the events are in the form of $(i,j,t)$, where $(i,j)$ is the pair of nodes involved in the interaction event, and $t$ is the occurrence time. The proposed method first estimate the intensity function $\lambda_{i,j}(t)$ of events between each pair of nodes $(i,j)$ at every time instant $t$, then project the intensities of each node at time $t$ onto a learned lower dimensional subspace to obtain a representation. Theoretical results on the recovery error of the representation is provided. Numerical experiments using real data shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. The paper proposes to estimate the representation of nodes using continuous-time events, which seems to be a novel type of data. I find the presentation of the paper generally vague and hand-wavy.

The authors aim to address the challenge of capturing temporal dynamics and evolving relationships in dynamic networks with both high statistical precision and interpretability. The model leverages the concept of intensity profiles, which encode the temporal changes and interactions between nodes in a network. The model provides a uniform error bound for learned node representations and preserves a novel ""temporal coherence"" property compared to existing baselines. Empirical results on real-world dynamic network datasets demonstrate that IPP outperforms existing methods in various tasks such, highlighting its ability to capture continuous-time representations and uncover temporal patterns in dynamic networks. 1. The paper introduces the Intensity Profile Projection (IPP) framework, which offers a unique and innovative approach to continuous-time representation learning for dynamic networks. It introduces the concept of intensity profiles and effectively utilizes them to capture temporal dynamics. 

2. Theoretical analysis towards the model shows that the model can achieve high statistical precision and preserve interpretability in terms of """"temporal coherence"".

3. The paper is in general easy to follow. 1. Lack of comparison with state-of-the-art methods: Although the paper claims improved performance over existing methods, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with some existing continuous models such as GraphODEs\[1,2,3,4\] which combines neuralODE with GNNs to model network evolution over time.

2. Scalability: The scalability of the IPP framework is not extensively discussed. It would be valuable to address the computational requirements and scalability limitations of the proposed approach, especially when dealing with large-scale dynamic networks.

3. The related work section is too short to provide a comprehensive background of the research topic.

175,Sabbir-Rashid,The Numerate Web: Mathematical Formulas and Computations on the Web of Data,"Ontologies and related Semantic Web technologies are applied in many areas where\nmathematical relationships are essential to the domain knowledge.\nHowever, unlike ontologies and logical rule languages, mathematical expressions\nand calculation rules are not an intrinsic part of the linked data\nrepresentation. Therefore, additional mapping processes between semantic domain\nmodels and the programs executing the mathematical computations are usually\nrequired.\nThe Numerate Web is an approach to representing mathematical models with RDF,\nlinking them to RDF resources and properties, running computations, and finally\nalso making the results available as part of the RDF representation.","SWJ Review In this article, the author presents the Numerate Web, an approach that leverages and extends earlier work to advance the support for the representation of mathematical models in RDF. This work has a significant potential impact, is well-motivated, and is supported through the demonstration of examples. The syntax and incorporated shorthand notations for incorporating mathematical equations are well explained and several algorithms for calculation execution are provided. Nevertheless, despite the numerous strengths of this article, the major shortcoming is the lack of a rigorous quantitative evaluation of the approach. Instead, how this work can be leveraged in the context of two case studies is provided. Additionally, the mathematics in the examples included were relatively straightforward. Could this approach be used for calculus or solving differential equations? There is a mention regarding the incorporation of time-varying behavior as future work, but the discussion on the limitation of this approach should be extended. In terms of mathematics, it should be made very clear what this approach can and cannot do. Listed below are many of the grammatical issues found within the article. Several issues were likely missed, so it is highly recommended that the author addresses the following and also carefully proofreads the article afterward. For example, I didn't comment on the use of Oxford commas, but you mostly use them but in some places do not. Whether or not to use Oxford commas is debatable, but whatever you decide, it should be consistent throughout the paper.

148,Reviewer-DES2,Proper Laplacian Representation Learning,"The ability to learn good representations of states is essential for solving large reinforcement learning problems, where exploration, generalization, and transfer are particularly challenging. The _Laplacian representation_ is a promising approach to address these problems by inducing informative state encoding and intrinsic rewards for temporally-extended action discovery and reward shaping. To obtain the Laplacian representation one needs to compute the eigensystem of the graph Laplacian, which is often approximated through optimization objectives compatible with deep learning approaches. These approximations, however, depend on hyperparameters that are impossible to tune efficiently, converge to arbitrary rotations of the desired eigenvectors, and are unable to accurately recover the corresponding eigenvalues. In this paper we introduce a theoretically sound objective and corresponding optimization algorithm for approximating the Laplacian representation. Our approach naturally recovers both the true eigenvectors and eigenvalues while eliminating the hyperparameter dependence of previous approximations. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method and we show that those results translate empirically into robust learning across multiple environments.","The paper develops three methods for smoothing in state-space models (SSMs). The idea is to assume SSMs that are non-linear and avoid other assumptions like Gaussianity when using variational inference. The drivin gidea is to preserve the temporal structure in the variational proposal. This seems to lead to what is called exponential family dynamical systems, that it a double-looped (forward and backward) chain of markovian conditionals. Having carefully checked the exponential family derivations, the parameterization, as well as the derived ELBOs, I feel that likely they are correct and well-founded on previous related work. The use of exponential families in this context, and particularly to build the factorization into markovian conditionals is definitely a strenght. The work itself is clear and concise on the details, also mentioning limitations and reasoning on why certain decisions are taken. To me the paper has two main weaknesses:

\[w1\] — the paper is in general concise and thorough, but written in a way that the smoothing idea is kind of lost. Particularly, technical details jump in for solving issues of previous technical details (derivations begin at the beginning of pp. 2 and finish at the end of pp. 7). In that way, the paper loses quite a lot of space, and story on the general smoothing idea that authors want to solve (and in which way they want to solve it). 

\[w2\] — the second concern to me is the limited results. Having derived long technical details, the manuscript should at least provide results proportional to the technical development. In my opinion, the evaluation of the model is somehow short (learning of two synthetic systems (pendulum and chaotic scenario) plus analysis on convergence). Not technical questions",282,0,2,0.7676000000000001,0.0099206349,0.7749239206,48,41.0469,0.1262,iclr,0.0246913580246913,2,2,2,2,partially factual,2,3,40,polite,3,negative,3,high,1,5,1,1,unfactual,3,4,20,polite,1,negative,4,low,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,factual,4.0,4.0,70.0,polite,4.0,neutral,3.0,low,2,3,2,2,unfactual,3,3,30,polite,1,positive,3,moderate,3,4,3,4,partially factual,4,4,75,polite,3,neutral,4,low
53,Reviewer-A92f,Deep Generalized Prediction Set Classifier and Its Theoretical Guarantees,"A standard classification rule returns a single-valued prediction for any observation without a confidence guarantee, which may result in severe consequences in many critical applications when the uncertainty is high. In contrast, set-valued classification is a new paradigm to handle the uncertainty in classification by reporting a set of plausible labels to observations in highly ambiguous regions. In this article, we propose the Deep Generalized Prediction Set (DeepGPS) method, a network-based set-valued classifier induced by acceptance region learning. DeepGPS is capable of identifying ambiguous observations and detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) observations. It is the first set-valued classification of this kind with a theoretical guarantee and scalable to large datasets. Our nontrivial proof shows that the risk of DeepGPS, defined as the expected size of the prediction set, attains the optimality within a neural network hypothesis class while simultaneously achieving the user-prescribed class-specific accuracy. Additionally, by using a weighted loss, DeepGPS returns tighter acceptance regions, leading to informative predictions and improved OOD detection performance. Empirically, our method outperforms the baselines on several benchmark datasets.","This paper presents a new method that combines set-valued prediction with out-of-distribution detection in multi-class classification problems. The central idea is a risk minimization framework with a loss function that consists of three parts. The first two parts trade off set size and accuracy, while a weight parameter controls which of the two terms is more important. The third term allows to exclude atypical examples from acceptance regions. In addition, the penultimate layer of the neural uses random fourier features to approximate a Gaussian kernel. 

The authors present theoretical results that present (a) the quality of the random Fourier feature approximation (b) the convergence to Bayes risk when sample size increases. In the experiments the proposed methods is compared to three baselines on three datasets and three metrics. The metrics evaluate the set-valued prediction and OOD detection performance. - The presented method is novel
- Overall the paper is well written (but some parts are unclear, see below)
- I agree with the authors that combined set-valued prediction and OOD detection is a key concept in satefy-critical applications of AI. 
- I liked that the authors describe the problem setting and the assumptions formally (Assumptions 1 and 2). This is often missing in OOD detection papers. This is a quite technical paper, and I am afraid that I don't understand the method very well, despite having a background on the topic and spending quite some time to read the paper. The last part of objective function (1) is unclear to me. What are lambda_k and rho_k? Are these explained in the paper? The authors explain that rho_k is used to exclude atypical examples from acceptance regions, but I don't see yet how that's going on. Also, why is a Frobenius-penalty needed for the parameter matrices? This is quite atypical for deep learning methods, where regularization is typically done via early stopping in SGD.

Furthermore, the need for random Fourier features in the penultimate layer of the neural network is also unclear to me. What does this component add to the method, compared to just propagating the embedding to the output layer? 

I also find the connection to existing literature a bit weak. The literature on OOD detection is vast, so I understand that the authors cannot discuss every paper, but some essential papers are definitely missing. Assumption 1 clearly motivates why generative models / density-based models are a good approach to represent P(x|y) as a first step for combined set-valued prediction and OOD detection. The authors discuss a few methods that model P(x|y), such as the unpublished work of Hechtlinger et al. However, there are many other papers that also model P(x|y), such as:
Charpentier et al. Posterior network: Uncertainty estimation without ood samples via density-based pseudo-counts, ICLR 2021
Van Amersfoort et al. Uncertainty estimation using a single deep deterministic neural network, ICML 2020
Lee et al. A Simple Unified Framework for Detecting Out-of-Distribution Samples and Adversarial Attacks, Neurips 2018

Perhaps those papers don't evaluate set-valued prediction, but they can be immediately used for such purposes. From that perspective, I would argue that such methods are also better baselines than the current baselines. These methods are deep learning methods, and they are published, unlike two of the three papers that are currently used as baselines. If I would have to do simultaneous set-valued prediction and OOD detection for a specific application, I would be more tempted to try these methods first instead of the method proposed here, because for methods that model P(x|y) it is more clear what they are doing. For the proposed method I am not sure whether it is modelling a class-specific density P(x|y). This might be realized via the random Fourier features, but more explanation would be needed. 

Furthermore, in set-valued prediction there are also quite some methods that consider loss functions that consist of two parts: a part that minimizes accuracy, and another part that minimizes set size, see e.g. 
Mortier et al. Efficient set-valued prediction in multi-class classification, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 2020. 
Titouan Lorieul, Uncertainty in predictions of deep learning models for fine-grained classification, PhD thesis, University of Montpellier, France. 

The proposed method has a lot of connections with such methods, but there are two differences: (1) the proposed method has an additional third part in the loss, (2) the other methods typically fit a probabilistic model first, and optimize set-based utility scores during the inference phase. Perhaps these two differences are enough to behave good for OOD detection as well, but that's still unclear to me.

Also, it is the first set-valued classification with a theoretical guarantee and scalable to large datasets. In theory, this paper provides that DeepGPS attains the optimal expected prediction set size, while achieving the user-prescribed class-specific accuracy. The efficacy of DeepGPS is demonstrated by using MNIST/CIFAR10/Fashion-MNIST datasets and multiple baselines. This paper proposes a learning approach for DeepGPS along with its theoretical properties in Thm1-3. I appreciate the authors' careful analysis on the algorithm. I was initially surprised that the proposed approach can achieve a user-prescribed class-specific accuracy \gamma without training a base model and additional set predictor in a decoupled way. However, I found that it is simply due to the hyperparameter C tuning in a validation set. In this regard, I found that the stated guarantee in (1) of Thm3 is largely disconnected to the empirical results. 

Afterward, I was not convinced whether we actually need this complicated way in training the entire neural network. I’d rather simply use conformal prediction for the specified task (e.g., BCOPS). 

Also in representing the main results in Table 1, I think the class-specific accuracy results should be bolded if they are close to the desired level; however, the maximum values are bolded. 1. Based on the appendix, the hyperparameter C is chosen to achieve the desired class-specific accuracy, i.e., “The tuning parameter C is determined such that the prediction set is smallest on the unlabeled part in the validation data when the misclassification rate is close to γ on the labeled part in the validation data.” Then, what’s the meaning of (1) of Thm3? I think without this theorem, we can heuristically achieve the desired class-specific accuracy via hyperparameter tuning over a validation set. 

2. Related to the above question, can you re-evaluate the benefit of DeepGPS compared to BCOPS? I think simple training in a decoupled way provides a stronger guarantee. 

3.  In Table 1, is there a specific reason that the accuracies are highlighted when it is the largest number? Otherwise, please use bold numbers if the class-specific accuracy results are close to the desired level.",376,0,3,0.783,-0.0018571429,0.9310600758,48,29.803,0.8641000000000001,iclr,0.0,4,4,3,4,partially factual,3,4,75,neutral,4,neutral,4,moderate,5,5,4,5,factual,5,5,90,polite,5,neutral,5,low,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,factual,3.0,4.0,80.0,polite,4.0,neutral,5.0,none,3,4,4,3,factual,4,4,75,polite,5,neutral,5,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low
128,Reviewer-TLX1,OSRT: An Online Sparse Approximation Model for Scattered Data,"Online learning is a crucial technique for dealing with large and evolving datasets in various domains, such as real-time data analysis, online advertising, or financial modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel predictive statistical model called the Online Sparse Residual Tree (OSRT) for handling streaming multivariate scattered data. OSRT is based on online tree decomposition and online adaptive radial basis function (RBF) exploration. OSRT dynamically expands its network depth as more data arrives, and incorporates a sparse and appropriate RBF refinement at each child node to minimize the residual error from its parent node. OSRT also uses an incremental method to explore the central node of the RBF function, ensuring both sparsity and accuracy of the model. When the network reaches its maximum depth, the OSRT model updates the RBF approximation of its final layer based on the most recent data. This ensures that the model captures the latest trends in the evolving data. We evaluate our algorithm on several datasets, and compare it with existing online RBF methods. From the results, it is shown that OSRT achieves higher efficiency and accuracy.","This paper proposes a method, Online Sparse Residual Tree (OSRT) for
handling streaming multivariate scattered data. The proposed
method is built on the sparse residual tree (SRT) method proposed in \[Xu & Luo, 2022\] and extended to deal with
evolving data efficiently in an online fashion.

The proposed OSRT model dynamically updates the tree structure by adding or deleting neurons and by splitting nodes as a new training sample arrives.
Experiments demonstrate that the ORST method has superior performance to other online algorithms. - With the proposed online extension, the SRT framework can now learn streaming data in an online fashion to predict future data.
- The experiments demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art base-line methods in the literature. - There are some imprecise parts which make it difficult to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method. For example, in Section 2.2, on page 5, the sentence ""then we set the."" is incomplete. Algorithm 1 is not fully explained in the text. For example, FindLeaf() in step 3 is not defined in the text. The step 9 seems to contradict what they say in the text. I supporse if the condition is NOT satisfied then it should do splitting. On page 5, the authors state that ""We have mentioned ... as $N_{max} = 1.2 N_{\chi}$,"" but they never mentioned it earlier.
- The SRT, which is the previous work, is treated as if originally proposed in this paper. The authors should clearly split Section 2 into two separate sections, one for explaining the previous SRT as background and the other for the proposed online extensions. 
- The details of the hyperparameter settings used in the experiments are missing completely. The hyperparameters include the maximum tree depth $d_{max}$, the factor $\theta_s$, the stack size $N_l$ and the error threshod $\Delta_1$. Changing their values may influence their performance and setting them to appropriate values may be non-trivial. However, none of their concrete values nor
their robustness to the performance in the experiments is reported. Because OSRT is an extension of SRT, I would like to know the performance difference
between the original SRT and its online version OSRT. The ORST is an online algorithm and evaluates each
sample only once according to Algorithm 1 on page 7. Therefore 
some performance degradation is expected against SRT, while OSRT is more
computationally efficient. The extent of the performance degradation is important
information to understand the potential of the proposed method and should be reported.

Minor comments:

In Section 2 on page 2, the Gaussian kernel is defined as $\theta_j(x)$ that includes $c_j$ as its center vector but a different
symbol $\phi_j(x)$ is used in the following equation. 
On page 4, $\phi_{\delta_l}(X_{li} -\chi_j)$ is used, where the definition of $\phi_{\delta_l}(x)$ does not include $c_j$ and the suffix of $\phi_{\delta_l}$ is the shape parameter, while the suffix of $\phi_j$ is the node index.

On page 4, $\sum_{i=1}^{t_q}$ should be $\sum_{i=1}^{q}$.

In Section 2.1, $\prec t_q$ is defined but $t_q$ is not defined at all and is still used in a couple of places.

In Equation (8), the notation $r_l(x)$ is misleading. It should be $r_l(X_l)$ as  used
later in $Q^T_{q+1}r_l(X_l)$.

In Section 2.3 on page 6, the definition of $S_m$ is unclear. $S_m$ is supposed to be a vertex of Voronoi diagram.

The right hand side of Equiation (1) : $\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\chi}} \alpha_i \phi_{\delta_l}(x)$ is confusing because 
$\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\chi}} \alpha_i \phi_{\delta_l}(x) = \phi_{\delta_l}(x)\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\chi}} \alpha_i $",568,0,0,0.7098,0.067958153,0.9277796745,49,56.0736,0.2552,iclr,0.0,5,5,5,5,factual,4,4,90,polite,4,negative,5,none,5,4,4,5,partially factual,4,5,85,polite,5,neutral,5,moderate,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,partially factual,4.0,3.0,60.0,polite,5.0,neutral,5.0,moderate,4,4,4,4,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low

From the results, it is shown that OSRT achieves higher efficiency and accuracy.","The paper extends methods for radial basis function (RBF) neural networks to predict time-series to online models---named an ""online sparse residual tree"" (OSRT) model. OSRT involves building a sparse tree in which the RBF networks reside.  To address streaming time-series, the model's online adaptation is done by thresholding the current mean squared residual error as new data arrives. The paper presents several novel ideas, by combining RBF networks, sparse regressison trees, and online updating for time series prediction. The paper lacks a principled approach to model design and evaluation, appearing to have little rationale in the combination of methods used beyond their adaptation from the recent literature, and their apparent heuristic value.  Typically one would expect a cross validation step as part of the algorithm when complexity parameters or thresholds are called for in a model.  

The exposition is hard to follow at best, and at times incomplete, or the symbols are incorrect. 
For instance, in Section 2: 

- Gaussian kernel is designated \theta, but in the approximation the character \phi is used -- are these the same thing? Note that \theta is reused with a different meaning in Equation (17).

- After equation (2) the phase ""Where Nχ is the number of neurons in this node, δl is the shape parameter."" makes no sense since neither variables appear in the previous formula.  The rest of that paragraph has similar problems with reference to variables not introduced in the equations that it attempts to explain. 

In general, one needs a principled method for determining the complexity of the model, e.g. the number of nodes, such as cross validation, or use of complexity penalty terms, e.g. in BIC. Is the maximum tree depth (Section 2.2) something one calculates, or is it a parameter one setd? Simply considering when ""the increase in the number of nodes no longer yields significant improvements in approximation quality"" will lead to overfitting. ""Significant improvement"" is not a principled method. There are many terms introduced in the explanation of the model that are introduced but not explained:  Could you describe the tree in terms of its layers?  What is the ""split rule"" and what is the stopping condition referred in the paragraph following Equation (2)?  In what sense is it sparse? Is there a sparsification step?  What do you mean in Section 2.1 by ""quasi-uniform""?  Are your ""mean points"" C the same as your centers?

1. There is no formal problem definition in the introduction, which makes it almost impossible for non-experts to understand the paper. 

2. The introduction part is too short and not very informative. The authors should at least illustrate some of the backgrounds of online regression analysis and highlight existing challenges.

It tackles the significant challenge of mitigating the computational costs and latency associated with vision-language models. Within this framework, two essential components come into play: Cross-Guided Matching and Ensemble, orchestrating the fusion of tokens guided by cross-modal cues, and Complete-Graph Soft Matching, contributing to the refinement of token matching outcomes. 1.Comprehensive Experimentation and Solid Theoretical Foundation: The paper's strength lies in its extensive and well-documented experiments, combined with a rigorous theoretical underpinning for the proposed method. This makes the work sound and reliable, both in terms of its theoretical framework and practical applicability.
2. Relevance of the Addressed Problem: The choice of the problem addressed in the paper holds significant value, especially in the context of the substantial computational overhead associated with many state-of-the-art multimodal models. This highlights the practical importance of the research. However, it is recommended that the authors extend their analysis and experimentation to encompass a broader range of models, moving beyond the initial exploration with BLIP-2. This would further enhance the paper's contribution and generalizability. 1. Cross-Modal Guidance Utilization: In the paper, the emphasis is placed on the ability of CrossGET to be applied to modality-dependent models like BLIP and BLIP2. The approach involves learning a cross-token to serve as guidance for another modality. However, there are concerns about this approach. Taking BLIP as an example, it appears that it may not fully harness textual guidance. In scenarios like visual grounding, where different textual descriptions highlight various aspects of the same image, it raises questions about how CrossGET selects tokens from different texts to focus on.
2. Unfair Experimental Comparisons: The paper contains instances of unfair comparisons in the experiments. For example, in section 4.1, the authors directly compare retrieval results of models such as TRIPS and UPOP. Yet, these models vary significantly in terms of training data and model parameter sizes, making the comparison less meaningful. To provide a clearer perspective, the paper should emphasize how much TRIPS, or similar acceleration methods, improve over the baseline, and how much the proposed method accelerates and enhances performance compared to the baseline.
3. Limited Model Performance Improvement: The paper reports only marginal improvements in model performance while introducing a relatively complex method. Moreover, the acceleration achieved by the proposed method appears similar to that of ToMe. Given the relative complexity of the proposed approach, the effectiveness of this work may be questioned, especially if the gains in performance and acceleration are not substantial. 1. Implementation of Token Reduction in BLIP-2: It would be beneficial for the authors to provide more detailed information on how they specifically implemented token reduction in BLIP-2 within the context of their method. A more elaborate explanation of the process and its impact on BLIP-2's performance would enhance the clarity and completeness of the paper.
2. Impact of CrossGET on OPT in BLIP-2: A notable aspect of this work is the introduction of CrossGET into the frozen OPT component of BLIP-2 for token reduction. However, it's important to consider that OPT is a decoder-only model. The paper should address how this approach might affect the inference capabilities of OPT and whether any experiments were conducted to analyze and verify why image captioning performance appears to be minimally impacted. Further insight into this aspect of the methodology would enhance the paper's robustness and contribute to a better understanding of the results.Im glad to improve my score if my   concerns be addressed.",586,0,6,0.7977000000000001,0.1171066253,0.94465065,48,25.0653,0.1262,iclr,0.0,2,5,4,3,factual,3,4,78,polite,4,neutral,4,moderate,4,4,4,4,partially factual,4,3,75,polite,5,neutral,5,moderate,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,factual,3.0,4.0,70.0,polite,4.0,neutral,3.0,low,4,4,4,4,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low

The key contributions of CrossGET can be summarized as follows: 1) CrossGET incorporates cross-modal guided information through cross-modal tokens. 2) CrossGET employs the Complete-Graph Soft Matching (CGSM) strategy, which offers more reliable token-matching results compared to existing bipartite soft matching strategies. Experimental evaluations conducted across multiple models, datasets, and tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. The acceleration of VL models is highly relevant for their practical deployment. While this paper presents promising results and extensive evaluations, there are important concerns that should be addressed before publication.
1. Some experimental results are perplexing. Table 1 suggests that ToMe performs worse when equipped with Adapter or ExtraToken. However, Adapter and VPT are parameter-efficient tuning methods that enhance performance with minimal additional parameters. It is unclear how they could instead degrade performance. I suspect there may be errors in the implementations. It is recommended to double-check the results or provide convincing explanations. Additionally, the upper-right subfigure in Figure 4 is also confusing. In my understanding, CrossGET and ToMe have close GFLOPs under the same configuration (as evident from the left subfigure). Therefore, the significant differences in GFLOPs for each data point pair in the upper-right subfigure indicate that they are compared under different configurations. A reasonable explanation should be provided here. Moreover, the down-right subfigure seems to be unusual as well. How is it possible for the model to achieve even better performance (nearly 86) with only 1/10 GFLOPs? Are the settings the same as in other figures?

2. The contribution of the Complete-Graph Soft Matching (CGSM) appears to be minor. For instance, Table 1 suggests that ToMe and CrossGET $\Delta$ perform similarly in different metrics, indicating that the proposed CGSM may have little impact. ToMe employs the bipartite soft matching strategy for its efficiency and simplicity, and the ToMe paper demonstrates that this strategy can approximate optimal matching through extensive combination experiments. This paper should provide more evidence (visualizations, analytical experiments) to justify the effectiveness of the proposed CGSM.

3. Most experiments in this paper focus on Image-Text retrieval tasks. Is the proposed method equally effective in other VL tasks, such as the CoOP benchmark or open vocabulary segmentation?

4. This paper lacks an important comparison. \[1\] proposes reducing the number of tokens through clustering and demonstrates better performance than ToMe in accelerating transformers. However, this paper only briefly mentions it in the introduction without further discussion or comparisons. It is recommended to include more comparisons (\[1\] vs. CrossGET $\Delta$, \[1\] + CGM&CGE vs. CrossGET $\star$, etc., better in dense prediction tasks) with \[1\].

I am glad to increase my rating if my concerns are addressed.

Specifically, this work introduces complete-graph matching to partition tokens and merge/reduce tokens based on similarities. The experimental results on common vision-language tasks demonstrate some effectiveness of the proposed method. The paper is well-organized and the presentation is good. The motivation of accelerating VLMs is clear. 1. The major issue is novelty. CrossGET is incremental over ToMe by replacing ToMe's matching algorithm, adding learnable tokens and adapt unimodal ToMe to the multimodal setting.
2. As shown in Table 1, the newly proposed matching algorithm has marginal improvements.
3. CrossGET is proposed to accelerate heavy VLMs. However, majority of experiments are carried out on relatively light-weighted BLIP. There's only a small section for the truly heavy BLIP2, which is a stronger VLM that really needs acceleration.
4. CrossGET requires fine-tuning of VLMs. (1) In most cases, when models need fine-tuning, they are relatively small (acceleration is not demanding). (2) Huge VLMs that are really heavy can be used as zero-shot in different tasks or different datasets of a same task.

79,Reviewer-LDAP,Farzi Data: Autoregressive Data Distillation,"We study data distillation for auto-regressive machine learning tasks, where the input and output have a strict left-to-right causal structure. More specifically, we propose Farzi, which summarizes an event sequence dataset into a small number of synthetic sequences — Farzi Data — which are optimized to maintain (if not improve) model performance compared to training on the full dataset. Under the hood, FARZI conducts memory-efficient data distillation by (i) deriving efficient reverse-mode differentiation of the Adam optimizer by leveraging Hessian-Vector Products; and (ii) factorizing the high-dimensional discrete event-space into a latent-space which provably promotes implicit regularization. Empirically, for sequential recommendation and language modeling tasks, we are able to achieve 98 − 120% of downstream full-data performance when training state-of-the-art models on Farzi Data of size as little as 0.1% of the original dataset. Notably, being able to train better models with significantly less data sheds light on the design of future large auto-regressive models, and opens up new opportunities to further scale up model and data sizes.","The authors introduce a dataset distillation (DD) method called Farzi Data for data with a ""left to right"" (autoregressive) causal structure. Their algorithm has two novel elements: 1) the parameterization of the synthetic distilled data, which allows them to apply it to discrete data (such as the tokens in language modeling); and 2) a method for computing the outer loop gradient for DD when the inner loop is performed with Adam, which has a constant memory footprint independent of the number of inner optimization steps. They conduct extensive experiments with their proposed method on language modeling and sequential recommendation tasks. Compared to existing DD methods (adapted to discrete data via their parameterization), they obtain improved performance across the tested datasets, often obtaining downstream performance better than training a model on the entire original dataset. **Algorithmic Contribution.** Algorithm 1 for computing the gradient through the inner-loop optimization with Adam using constant memory is a significant contribution. Among existing dataset distillation methods, those which take into account the entire training trajectory on the distilled data tend to obtain better accuracy (as compared to other methods which use surrogates for this objective such as the gradient matching objective in dataset condensation). However, the computational burden of these methods (specifically the memory requirement, which necessitates keeping the entire computation graph) renders them infeasible for application to larger datasets. Farzi Data takes a significant step towards addressing this problem by introducing an algorithm for differentiating through an inner loop optimized with Adam, whose memory does not scale with the number of steps in the inner loop (see Fig. 5). This is an important improvement for DD to be practically useful in real ML applications.

**Empirical Results.** The empirical results are also impressive. The authors obtain better performance than competing methods across several different real-world benchmarks. There are even scenarios where their distilled data consistently outperforms training on the entire original dataset (cf. Table 1), indicating that Farzi Data implicitly promotes some sort of ""data cleaning"" whereby samples that *hurt* model performance are removed or discounted. This is similar to, e.g., removing mislabeled points or data with negative Shapley values, but Farzi Data is not explicitly trained for this task. **Presentation and Clarity.** While the actual prose of the paper was generally clear and easy to read, there are some major concerns with notation/presentation that limit understanding of some of the main contributions of the paper.

P1. There are many cases where important notation is not defined. For instance, $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{D})$ is defined in the Appendix, but not the main text, and is critical to interpreting Theorem 3.1. It is not stated what the terms $d\mathbf{m}$, $d\mathbf{x}$, and $d\mathbf{w}$ in Algorithm 1 are supposed to be, so it is impossible to determine if the expressions are correct or not. How to construct the output of the algorithm from these quantities is also not clear. What is the correspondence of the quantities in Alg. 1 to the DD problem, i.e., what will we actually update using the meta-gradient once we know how to compute it? Some (but not all) of these details can be found in the Appendix, but as they are critical to being able to understand the results, they should be moved to the main text and given appropriate explanations.

P2. Stylistically, there is also some nonstandard notation. For instance, $\mathcal{O}(100)$ (3rd bullet point, pg. 2). I suppose the authors meant ""on the order of 100x"", but big-O notation has a mathematically precise meaning that doesn't make sense here. Another instance is Proposition 3.2. ""Correctness of Algorithm 1, Line 13"" is not a complete mathematical statement (or a complete sentence). The result should be stated completely and precisely.

**Theoretical Results.** There are also issues with the theoretical results.

T1. The most critical problem is that the proof of the main theorem (Theorem 3.1) is not mathematically sound. Specifically, the authors want to show that the expected representativeness of their low-rank synthetic data parameterization is strictly less than the expected representativeness of a naive synthetic data parameterization, under some suitable conditions and for quadratic classifiers: $\mathbb{E}\[\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{D}_F)\] < \mathbb{E}\[\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{D}_N)\]$. ($\mathcal{D}_F$ and $\mathcal{D}_N$ stand for Farzi and naive data, respectively.) In their proof in Appendix B.1, they show that $\mathbb{E}\[\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{D}_F)\] < B_1$ and $\mathbb{E}\[\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{D}_N)\]$ for some bounds $B_1$ and $B_2$. Then, since $B_1 < B_2$, they conclude the desired result. This is not valid: $a < b$, $c < d$, and $b < d$ does not imply that $a < c$. There needs to be a _lower_ bound on the representativeness for the naive parameterization.

I remark that I believe the _result_ is (at least ""morally"") correct. The theorem essentially reduces to saying that the Rademacher complexity resulting from the low-rank parameterization is smaller than the Rademacher complexity from a general parameterization, which is intuitively obvious. However, the _proof_ has a fatal error and must be corrected somehow.

T2. For Lemma B.3 to hold, there must clearly be some assumptions on the loss function $l$; in order to apply the lemma from Shalev-Shwartz, the Rademacher complexity of the loss composed with the models in $\mathcal{F}$ must be considered, not $\mathcal{F}$ itself. As stated, I believe this lemma is not correct and the loss must be accounted for. Apart from the logical error, the motivation for the use of quadratic classifiers in the theorem wasn't clear to me. What connection do such models have to the auto-regressive tasks that Farzi Data is applied to?

T3. This is related to the presentation problems regarding the notation used in Algorithm 1, but the proof of Proposition 3.2 is also suspect. What is meant by $d\mathbf{m} = d\mathbf{m} + \frac{\partial w_t}{\partial m_t} \cdot d\mathbf{w}$? Is $w_t$ supposed to be $\mathbf{w}_T$, or is this expression meant to be a recursive formula? What about the formulas for the other quantities, and how are these combined to compute the meta gradient?

If these issues can be satisfactorily addressed, along with the questions in the section below, I would be willing to raise my score to accept, given how promising the empirical results are. Q1. The authors mention that training with the reference trajectories $\Omega$ is important for obtaining the best performance, as compared with training only from randomly initialized networks. However, it wasn't clear to me if this might just have been the result of a greater number of training steps when learning the distilled dataset. That is, are the results in Fig. 6(b) with the total number of meta-gradient steps constant, or do the additional precomputed trajectories result in more meta-gradient steps?

Q2. On a related note, it was not clear to me exactly how the precomputed trajectories were used. My assumption was that instead of training the network in the inner loop only from random initializations, instead the network from the inner loop will be initialized with parameters from one of the training trajectories. Is this correct?

Q3. Why isn't FMLP also used as a teacher network in Table 1?",1161,0,13,0.7745000000000001,0.0963321995,0.9078657031,47,38.9031,0.0977,iclr,0.0,5,5,5,5,factual,3,5,98,neutral,5,neutral,4,none,5,5,5,5,factual,5,5,95,polite,5,neutral,5,none,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,partially factual,4.0,3.0,60.0,polite,5.0,neutral,5.0,low,5,4,5,5,factual,5,5,95,polite,5,positive,5,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low

Overall, the paper contains strong (albeit limited) empirical results on the sequence modeling (penn tree bank) and recommendation systems datasets. * The high level motivation of the problem is quite the need of the hour, as with larger models we need to better understand their dependencies on the data
* Pursuit of this research direction could potentially yield methods that enable us to train SOTA transformer models for a fraction of the input cost
* Empirical results are thorough, although a bit limited in terms of number of datasets for sequence modeling (only PTB is used) A number of points about the approach were unclear to me from the writeup, and I would appreciate clarifications from the authors:

* It is said that the complexity of the dataset distillation algorithm scales by the size of the vocabulary (page. 4) and the size of the sequence that we wish to model. I can see the latter to be the case, since the loss will now be summed over the entire sequence as opposed to one forward pass (so the complexity of the forward pass is increased). However, I do not see how the time complexity increases with the vocabulary size. Do we mean space complexity? Also, more than the forward pass the dominant factor in dataset distillation is the computation of a bunch of hessian vector products in the meta gradient. Those terms do not depend on the vocabulary size either… please clarify..
* It would be nice to provide an intuition for what is saving the memory, making things O(1) in memory.  Currently the big algorithm block does not provide an intuition for how this approach is O(1) in memory regardless of the number of timesteps of unrolling. This is important to clarify, since this is an important contribution, if clearly explained. If this approach is essentially gradient checkpointing, then it is worth noting that Deng and Russakovsky already implement a version of this in their code. 
* Looking at Eqn. 2, I am a bit puzzled as to how \Omega, namely the trajectories from the real data are incorporated in the DD process. From what I am able to understand, \theta_0 \sim Omega -- namely the init is sampled from the pretrained trajectories, and then from the right hand side of eqn. 2 I understand that the rest of the trajectory is obtained using Adam on the synthetic data. Where is the role of the pretrained trajectories then? Please explain..

* Rank regularization has been done in the previous work (Deng and Russakovsky) for dataset distillation. It should be cited that this has been done, and not be presented as a novelty.. My major questions concern the clarifications about the approach listed above, without which it is really hard to judge the technical correctness / soundness of the paper.",506,0,0,0.7575000000000001,0.0487258687,0.8768354654,47,45.1043,0.7308,iclr,0.0196078431372549,4,4,4,3,factual,4,4,80,polite,3,neutral,4,none,5,5,4,5,partially factual,5,5,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,factual,4.0,4.0,80.0,polite,4.0,neutral,3.0,none,4,4,4,4,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,positive,5,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low

This can include natural language text, but also general time-series data. Their method aims to summarize a dataset into a sequence of latent embeddings (which can subsequently be decoded) given a downstream task such that they achieve similar performance to training on the complete dataset. They do this through a meta-learning procedure, optimizing directly through Adam for data which lowers downstream task loss. My review comes from the point of view of someone familiar with training on natural language (and associated downstream evaluation), but not general event forecasting problems. I was not familiar with the benchmarks used by the author prior to reading this paper. 

**Originality and Significance**

- The paper seems original. Aspects of this work (e.g. using meta-learning/second order methods) for distillation have been touched on in the past, but usually for smaller datasets, and generally not for auto-regressive tasks. Most past works I have seen which work on large corpuses revolve around finding mixing coefficients for existing datasets \[1\]. This method doesn't work on datasets of that size, however this shows an improvement in scaling. 
- Getting a meta-learning approach to work on such dataset sizes is quite difficult, given difficulties with estimating second-order components over the full dataset. Scaling this to even larger language-style datasets would be an interesting (future) contribution.



**Quality and Clarity**

This paper is quite well-written. Experimental details are clear, and the method is properly motivated. Diagrams clarify the algorithm and the key difficulties to this method are highlighted appropriately.

- The authors touch on language datasets as a motivation, however do not study this (or other large-sequence tasks) due to practical model/sequence length scaling constraints. Are there reasonable paths forward that would allow this to scale to longer sequence lengths/larger models? 
- Given that the outer loop evaluates across the full original dataset, and the inner loop needs to be run several times to get updated parameters (Figure 5), what's the overall cost saving versus just training a model on the original dataset for more time (until matching student performance), if any? 
- Have the authors thought about cases where there is significant noise in the training corpus?

The goal is to condense the original large dataset into a much smaller number of synthetic sequences, so that downstream performance on the synthetic data matches (or even improves) performance on the full real dataset. The authors cast the problem using a bi-level optimization formulation, similar to meta-model matching based dataset distillation. The naive formulation is infeasible due to the very large token vocabulary and the maximum sequence length. To address this, the authors propose to factorize the synthetic dataset into a latent data summary and a token-decoder matrix. This renders the optimization continuous (as opposed to discrete), while it provides flexibility to sample synthetic sentences from a distribution (as opposed to having a fixed small set of synthetic sentences). Furthermore, the authors suggest to replace SGD in the inner loop by the Adam optimizer. To mitigate the large memory footprint, they derive an efficient approximation for reverse-model differentiation of the Adam optimization. The authors assess FARZI on sequential recommendation and language modeling tasks, where they manage to match or even exceed the downstream full-data performance using as little as 0.1% of the original dataset. The authors conduct several experiments and ablation studies to shed light on various aspects of their framework. The paper makes several interesting contributions. The meta-model matching based dataset distillation was originally proposed for continuous data (e.g., image data), as opposed to language data that use discrete tokens. The use of a latent space addresses this challenge by ensuring that the optimization can be performed in a continuous space, but by also allowing us to sample the synthetic sentences from a compact distribution. Furthermore, the observation that the Adam optimizer is a much better choice for the inner loop optimization (compared to SGD) is very interesting and dramatically improves downstream performance. To address the large memory footprint, the authors derive an efficient approximation of the reverse-mode differentiation of the Adam optimizer, which nicely complements their finding that Adam is better than SGD. Interestingly, this may be more broadly applicable in other bi-level optimization tasks (e.g., in a meta-learning context).

The paper is well written and the related work is covered quite extensively. The authors describe in detail the various insights of their framework. When it comes to the experimental evaluation, they provide a lot of information on the metrics, datasets, hyperparameters, objectives, and even architectures.

The experimental evaluation is quite convincing and supports the claims made by the authors. It is very interesting that FARZI can even outperform downstream performance on the full original dataset, which could indicate the improved robustness with dataset distillation. I liked the fact that the authors investigated various aspects of FARZI, such as the versatility of the synthetic data, the cross-architecture generalization, the performance of different meta-objectives, the cold start problem, and the impact of pre-trained trajectories. 1. Even though this paper makes interesting contributions to the DD literature for autoregressive tasks, it is not so obvious that it would be 
very helpful for much larger text corpora and large language models with millions or billions of parameters. The memory footprint might end up being very large, rendering the whole framework infeasible. Furthermore, a compression rate of 0.1% may not be extremely helpful for very large datasets consisting of billions of sentences. This may limit the applicability of FARZI to settings consisting of ""reasonably large but not very large"" language corpora.

2. It was not clear to me how time-consuming the FARZI dataset generation process is. For example, how long did it take to generate the synthetic datasets for the tasks considered in this work? In particular, did FARZI improve the total runtime? For instance, if generating the synthetic data takes very long, then there may be very little benefit (if any) from this process. Furthermore, it is not automatically obvious that a smaller dataset can be trained faster than a larger one. There is the added question of the number of epochs required to reach convergence. The synthetic dataset may require more rounds. This was not obvious in the experimental evaluation. If I am not mistaken, I feel that the subject of runtime was only superficially touched in this work, and a more thorough discussion (with detailed pros and cons) would be needed.
(Theoretically, this may not be a big issue if the same synthetic dataset could be successful used on several downstream tasks, but this is not immediately true. If we need dataset distillation for each separate task, then we may end up performing FARZI several times.) 1. Could the authors elaborate more on the total runtime (total time for synthetic dataset generation + total time for downstream training with synthetic vs. full data)? It would be helpful if the authors could shed light on the various questions/comments raised in Weakness (2) above.

2. In Equation (2), \Omega is a set containing initializations for the inner loop, if I understand correctly. But instead of picking the initialization randomly, these come from a small number of training trajectories on the full dataset. If that is true, then the \theta_i in the definition of \Omega has nothing to do with the update rule for \theta_t in Equation (2). This may still be confusing to some readers though because the same symbols are used (theta with a subscript, so the authors may want to clarify this point (i.e., what exactly is in \Omega).

3. I was not clear how exactly the authors chose the final hyperparameters for each setting. Did they exhaustively try all corresponding combinations in the hyperparameter table and picked the best one?

40,Reviewer-PzSz,Contextual Bandits and Imitation Learning with Preference-Based Active Queries,"We consider the problem of contextual bandits and imitation learning, where the learner lacks direct knowledge of the executed action's reward. Instead, the learner can actively request the expert at each round to compare two actions and receive noisy preference feedback. The learner's objective is two-fold: to minimize regret associated with the executed actions, while simultaneously, minimizing the number of comparison queries made to the expert. In this paper, we assume that the learner has access to a function class that can represent the expert's preference model under appropriate link functions and present an algorithm that leverages an online regression oracle with respect to this function class. For the contextual bandit setting, our algorithm achieves a regret bound that combines the best of both worlds, scaling as $O(\min\\{\sqrt{T}, d/\Delta\\})$, where $T$ represents the number of interactions, $d$ represents the eluder dimension of the function class, and $\Delta$ represents the minimum preference of the optimal action over any suboptimal action under all contexts. Our algorithm does not require the knowledge of $\Delta$, and the obtained regret bound is comparable to what can be achieved in the standard contextual bandits setting where the learner observes reward signals at each round. Additionally, our algorithm makes only $O(\min\\{T, d^2/\Delta^2\\})$ queries to the expert. We then extend our algorithm to the imitation learning setting, where the agent engages with an unknown environment in episodes of length $H$, and provide similar guarantees regarding regret and query complexity. Interestingly, with preference-based feedback, our imitation learning algorithm can learn a policy outperforming a sub-optimal expert, matching the result from interactive imitation learning algorithms [Ross and Bagnell, 2014] that require access to the expert's actions and also reward signals.","This paper studies the contextual bandit and imitation learning problem with preference-based feedback. The authors propose an oracle-based contextual bandit algorithm, which attains both worst-case and instance-dependent regret bounds. Besides, the algorithm has an instance-dependent guarantee on the querying numbers of the preference-based information. Furthermore, the proposed bandit algorithm is extended to the imitation learning setting with provable guarantees. - the proposed method has strong theoretical guarantees on the regret (both worst-case and instance-dependent bound) and query complexity. Although the oracle-based algorithm proposed shares similar techniques with MinMaxDB \[Saha and Krishnamurthy, 2022\] and AdaCB \[Foster et al., 2020\], the authors provide enough discussion to highlight the difference.
- lower bounds are provided to justify the upper bounds on regret, and query complexity is tight up to logarithmic factors
- the paper is well-structured and written - about the practical implementation of the proposed method: one of my main concerns about the paper is from the practical side. Similar to the oracle-based algorithm for the standard contextual bandit problem (e.g., SquareCB \[Foster et al. 2022\]), the proposed method is established on an online regression solver with regret guarantees. However, I'm not sure to what extent such an online regression solver can be obtained with the preference-based feedback model. For instance, as shown in example 1, $f(x, a,b) = r(a,x)-r(x,b)$, the function $f(\cdot)$ is not convex even $r:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\[0,1\]$ is a convex function, and the algorithm developed for online convex optimization is not applicable. I think it would be beneficial if the authors could provide some concrete examples (for example, the reward function has a linear structure?) that the online regression oracle is available. 

-  about the instance-dependent bound: the proposed instance-dependent regret bound as an $O(\Upsilon^2)$ dependence on the regret of the oracle and an  $O(\Upsilon^3)$ on the query complexity. There seems still some room for improvement. In the finite function space case, AdaCB attains an $O(\log \vert\mathcal{F}\vert/\Delta)$ bound for a standard contextual bandit problem, but the result obtained in this paper implies an $O(\log^2 \vert\mathcal{F}\vert/\Delta)$ regret bound. 


 - could you provide concrete examples of the online regression oracle for the preference-based feedback model? It would be even better if the author could provide more detailed discussions on to which extent such an online regression solver can be established.

- could you provide more discussion on the tightness of the instance-dependent bound, especially on the dependence of $\Upsilon$?

- The expert policy $\pi_e$ is not formally defined. Does $\pi_e$ refer to the policy that can maximize the value function? I am confused by the claim, ""our algorithm not only competes with the expert policy but can also surpass it to some extent"" in line 343. What is the formal definition of ""surpass."" Do you mean the regret would go negative due to the term $Adv_T$? However, it is unclear to me when the negative term is large enough to cancel the $O(\sqrt{T}, A/\Delta)$ term. The paper has discussed the limitation and potential future work in the conclusion. Another issue is that it imposes a realizable assumption for $f^\star$. It is unclear whether extending the analysis for standard contextual bandit (Section 5 in \[Foster et al., ICML 2020\]) to the contextual dueling bandit setting is possible.",533,1,0,0.7521,0.0431166056,0.9522576332,215,40.3366,0.5388000000000001,neurips,0.0,5,5,5,5,factual,5,5,100,polite,5,neutral,5,none,5,5,5,5,factual,5,5,95,polite,5,neutral,5,low,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,factual,3.0,4.0,80.0,polite,5.0,neutral,5.0,none,4,4,4,4,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low

For the contextual bandit setting, our algorithm achieves a regret bound that combines the best of both worlds, scaling as $O(\min\\{\sqrt{T}, d/\Delta\\})$, where $T$ represents the number of interactions, $d$ represents the eluder dimension of the function class, and $\Delta$ represents the minimum preference of the optimal action over any suboptimal action under all contexts. Our algorithm does not require the knowledge of $\Delta$, and the obtained regret bound is comparable to what can be achieved in the standard contextual bandits setting where the learner observes reward signals at each round. Additionally, our algorithm makes only $O(\min\\{T, d^2/\Delta^2\\})$ queries to the expert. We then extend our algorithm to the imitation learning setting, where the agent engages with an unknown environment in episodes of length $H$, and provide similar guarantees regarding regret and query complexity. Interestingly, with preference-based feedback, our imitation learning algorithm can learn a policy outperforming a sub-optimal expert, matching the result from interactive imitation learning algorithms [Ross and Bagnell, 2014] that require access to the expert's actions and also reward signals.","The paper gives “best-of-both-worlds” results for an imitation-learning problem in contextual bandits and MDP settings. With small orthogonal changes to assumptions, the algorithms primarily improve over prior work by considering instance-optimal bounds both in regret and queries, and require only ordinal preference feedback rather than explicit rewards (similar to the “dueling bandits“ literature).  - The paper is easy to read, the algorithms and notation are well-explained, and the results are appropriately contextualized in prior work.
- The examples given for the functions in the model are quite useful for grounding the problem in more concrete applications. Related work is discussed thoroughly.
- Conceptually, the model draws nice connections between contextual bandits and modern topics in finetuning models (e.g. LLMs) from preference feedback, where the emphasis on “instance-optimal” style results is particularly well-motivated. - While the application of techniques from online reinforcement learning to obtain the instance-optimal bounds in this setting is clever, it is unclear how much of this follows directly vs what technical innovation is required. It would be helpful to highlight the methodological contributions used.
- Given the applications discussed, it would be beneficial to give experimental results for preference finetuning (even in a toy setting) to demonstrate the importance of instance-optimality in practice.
- While the instance-optimal rates seem reasonable, it would be nice to include (partially) matching lower bounds for some results, or discuss barriers to obtaining such results. - Can the rates on $d$ or $\Delta$ be shown to be asymptotically tight for either queries or regret? 
- What does the notation $P_t\[a_t, b_t\]$ on line 146 refer to? - Connections to prior RL work which makes use of eluder dimension could be discussed in greater detail.

40,Reviewer-FECY,Contextual Bandits and Imitation Learning with Preference-Based Active Queries,"We consider the problem of contextual bandits and imitation learning, where the learner lacks direct knowledge of the executed action's reward. Instead, the learner can actively request the expert at each round to compare two actions and receive noisy preference feedback. The learner's objective is two-fold: to minimize regret associated with the executed actions, while simultaneously, minimizing the number of comparison queries made to the expert. In this paper, we assume that the learner has access to a function class that can represent the expert's preference model under appropriate link functions and present an algorithm that leverages an online regression oracle with respect to this function class. For the contextual bandit setting, our algorithm achieves a regret bound that combines the best of both worlds, scaling as $O(\min\\{\sqrt{T}, d/\Delta\\})$, where $T$ represents the number of interactions, $d$ represents the eluder dimension of the function class, and $\Delta$ represents the minimum preference of the optimal action over any suboptimal action under all contexts.

Interestingly, with preference-based feedback, our imitation learning algorithm can learn a policy outperforming a sub-optimal expert, matching the result from interactive imitation learning algorithms [Ross and Bagnell, 2014] that require access to the expert's actions and also reward signals.","This paper develops the provably efficient algorithms AURORA and AURORAE, which are able to achieve the optimal regret bound under contextual dueling bandit setting, and imitation learning respectively, at the same time minimizing query complexity. The key idea behind is that the algorithm only makes a query when the algorithm is very uncertain about the optimal action ($Z_t 1_{|A_t| > 1}$). The algorithm decides the sampling distribution of action pairs to make a query by considering whether the estimated cumulative regret exceeds the carefully designed threshold. If it does not exceed, the algorithm does exploration and sample action pairs from the uniform distribution. If it exceeds, the algorithm uses a technique similar to inverse gap weighting to achieve better balance between exploration and exploitation. For imitation setting with horizon H, the algorithm treats MDP as a concatenation of H contextual bandits and runs AURORAE, which is a stack of multiple AURORA instances. This work is original and well-motivated. It is crucial to design an online learning algorithm that achieves optimal regret while using minimal query complexity. Although I did not get a chance to read the complete proofs in the supplementary material carefully, given the discussion of intuition, all technical results seem reasonable to me. 

This paper is well presented and is a pleasure to read. An example for illustration follows every definition. All materials are well organized in a logical manner. 
 I have several concerns regarding the proposed algorithms. First, P5 I 5, the computational complexity for the candidate arm set might be very large, even if F is assumed to be a d-dimensional linear class. The computational complexity might be $O(dT\log(T)|A|)$. Also, in reality, F might be very complex, which might even worsen the computational complexity. Can we use a simple function class F for approximation while still achieving a similar regret bound?
 Please see the review in weaknesses.  The authors address their limitations of not having any experiments on real data or simulations. I believe the work will be much more convincing if the theoretical bounds are supported by experiment results.",344,0,0,0.8049000000000001,0.0822619048,0.9381507635,215,30.0936,0.3201,neurips,0.021978021978022,4,3,2,3,partially factual,2,3,55,polite,3,neutral,1,high,5,5,5,5,partially factual,5,5,90,polite,5,positive,5,moderate,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,factual,3.0,4.0,80.0,polite,5.0,positive,4.0,none,3,4,4,4,factual,4,4,80,polite,5,positive,5,low,3,5,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,positive,5,low
139,Ehab-Mohamed-Abd-El-Kaf,Parents’ satisfaction with physiotherapy services for neuropediatric outpatients in government and private hospitals in the United Arab Emirates: a cross-sectional study,"Background Healthcare, like other industries, emphasizes performance, quality, and consumer experience while also attempting to reduce costs. However, high-quality healthcare remains paramount for vulnerable and ill patients. This study aimed to investigate parents' and caregivers' level of satisfaction with physiotherapy services provided to neuropediatric outpatients on the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study included 103 parents/caregivers of children with neurological disabilities that were randomly selected from different Emirates Health Services Hospitals in the UAE. Data was collected using the long-form Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-III).  Results The overall mean satisfaction was 159±7.73 (out of 250 points). Communication (20.36/25), interpersonal factors (20.17/35), and doctor-patient time (20.17/35) had the highest mean satisfaction scores (8.06/10). The lowest mean satisfaction scores were for access/availability/convenience (34.60/60), technical quality (33.17/50), and economic elements (23.83/40).  Conclusion Despite participants’ overall satisfaction scores being positive, some service domains require improvement to improve satisfaction, specifically the access/availability/convenience, technical quality, and economic elements. These areas should be prioritized by service providers and managers to improve patients’ experiences and clinical outcomes.","Approved  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.  Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  This manuscript makes a valuable contribution to understanding parental satisfaction with physiotherapy services for children with neurological disabilities in the UAE. The study highlights the local importance and relevance of this issue and provides useful insights for healthcare providers seeking to improve service quality. Overall, this manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of parental satisfaction with physiotherapy services for children with neurological disabilities in the UAE. Enhancing the introduction with additional references, clarifying secondary objectives, and providing more details on the sampling process and subgroup analyses would further improve the manuscript. Here are a detailed review of the sections. 1. The introduction is clear and effectively sets the stage for the study, emphasizing the importance of patient satisfaction in healthcare within the UAE's evolving landscape. While the background information on patient satisfaction is comprehensive, adding recent studies on similar settings would enhance this section. 2. The goals and objectives of the study are well-stated and align with the introduction. The aim to investigate parents' satisfaction with physiotherapy services for neuropediatric patients is clear. However, clarifying any secondary objectives would provide a more complete picture of the study's scope. 3. The methods section is detailed and well-organized, outlining the study design, participant recruitment, data collection, and analysis procedures. The use of the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-III) is well-justified, and ethical considerations are thoroughly addressed. More details on the sampling process, including selection criteria and potential biases, would improve transparency and replicability. 4. Results are presented clearly with tables that effectively illustrate key findings. The mean satisfaction scores for different service domains are well-documented, and the statistical analysis is sound. Including more detailed demographic data and subgroup analyses would provide additional context and highlight factors influencing parental satisfaction. 5. The discussion interprets the results well, relating them to existing literature and emphasizing the study's local significance. Identifying areas for improvement, such as access, technical quality, and economic elements, is valuable. The discussion could be enriched by exploring strategies for addressing these areas and discussing the implications for policy and practice in more detail. 6. Comparing the findings with similar studies in other regions would offer a broader perspective. 7. The conclusion succinctly summarizes the main findings and their implications, emphasizing the need for ongoing assessment and improvement of physiotherapy services. Including specific recommendations for future research and practice would strengthen the conclusion.  Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?

44,Slobodan-M-Janković,Correlation between serum methotrexate-polyglutamate 3 (MTX-PG3) level and disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis patients: A prospective cohort study,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, characterized by systemic inflammation, joint destruction and disability. Methotrexate (MTX) is used as the primary treatment for RA patients. However, the response to MTX therapy is highly varied and difficult to predict. This study sought to determine the role of MTX by measuring the MTX polyglutamate 3 (MTX-PG3) levels and the disease activity score 28 based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) of RA patients. Method: A prospective cohort study was conducted at the Rheumatology Polyclinic of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital. Thirty-four patients with RA were included and followed up to 12 weeks. The RA patients were treated with MTX 10 mg per week and an increased dose of 5 mg per week every month. DAS28-CRP and MTX-PG3 level were assessed at week 8 and 12. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the correlation between MTX-PG3 and DAS28-CRP. Result: A total of 34 RA patients were followed and the MTX was well tolerated in which no increase of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were observed. The mean scores of DAS28-CRP decreased following the MTX-treatment: 3.93, 3.22 and 2.82 at week 0, 8 and 12, respectively. In contrast, the median concentration of MTX-PG3 increased from week 8 to week 12 followed by increasing the dose of MTX. Our analysis suggested there was a moderate positive correlation between MTX-PG3 levels and DAS28-CRP score at week 8 and week 12 post-MTX treatment. Conclusion: The level of MTX-PG3 is correlated with DAS28-CRP score suggesting that MTX-PG3 could be used as an indicator to assess the disease activity in RA patients. Nevertheless, a prospective study with a higher number of patients is needed to confirm this finding.","Approved  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.

110,Cliff-Ragsdale,Longitudinal RNA sequencing of the deep transcriptome during neurogenesis of cortical glutamatergic neurons from murine ESCs,"Using paired-end RNA sequencing, we have quantified the deep transcriptional changes that occur during differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells into a highly enriched population of glutamatergic cortical neurons. These data provide a detailed and nuanced account of longitudinal changes in the transcriptome during neurogenesis and neuronal maturation, starting from mouse embryonic stem cells and progressing through neuroepithelial stem cell induction, radial glial cell formation, neurogenesis, neuronal maturation and cortical patterning.

The authors find that different group-wise clipping styles offer an accuracy-memory trade-off. While all-layer clipping is commonly used and provides better accuracy, it requires more memory compared to group-wise clipping. The paper formalizes this trade-off through convergence theory and complexity analysis. Importantly, it demonstrates that the accuracy gap between group-wise and all-layer clipping decreases with larger models, while the memory advantage of group-wise clipping remains, allowing DP optimization of large models with high accuracy and low peak memory usage. The paper addresses an important aspect of DP deep learning, namely gradient clipping, which is crucial for privacy-preserving training of large models. It thoroughly explored the design space of group-wise clipping styles for various learning tasks.

Empirical Experiments: The paper includes a good set of experiments to support its claims. **Motivation of Group-Wise Clipping**: In the abstract, the paper claims The paper lacks a clear and strong motivation for why group-wise clipping is a necessary or valuable alternative to all-layer clipping as **all group-wise clipping enjoy almost the same training speed as the standard non-DP optimization**. Meanwhile the memory cost does not differentiate too much across various grouping choices, either (see Table 3 and Figure 5).

**Confusing measures**: There are several terms used across the paper, e.g., time complexity, training speed, memory cost. The paper should define them clearly whether they are theoretically or empirically computed. If empirically, the training speed and the memory cost are jointly affected by the setup of the batch size, model size and the model architecture. Book-keeping technique would store the backward gradients on the output of each operation, the same as storing the activations, which may have memory problem when the batch size is large. 

As a following weak point, the paper does not talk about the implementation detail and wall-clock training speed comparison.  This is because the non-uniform grouping is complex to implement and the wall-clock training speed is the ultimate measure for different choices.
The cost of searching the best non-uniform grouping is not counted.

**Relevance of Theory**: The theoretical analysis may not provide sufficient insights into practical scenarios. The upper bound gets sub-linearly (sqrt) worse as the number of the groups increases, which is not reflected in real experiments. Theorem 2 is a bit trivial and does not convey much information related with the target of the paper. 


**Experiments presentation**: The experiments are cherry picked in the main text. It seems that the results of the paper are not as good as the result of He et al. 2022 in Appendix C, which are excluded from the main text. Moreover, all the experiments consider the fine-tuning setting, which is not clearly stated in the main text. There lack training scratch experiments for full comparison.

The authors also analyze the system wise metrics such as peak memory profile usage. Empirical results are given on GPT2 and ViT models. * The paper provides detailed analysis to the group-wise clipping technique in DP domain, some of the conclusions are interesting to this field.
* The authors give both insights from theory and system perspectives.
* The authors also set up new baseline results, which could potentially be a good reference for further work in this space. * From the peak memory profile results, i.e. Table 3 and Figure 5, it looks like the peak memory usages for different boundaries are pretty close (in general less than 2 GB). I'm not sure how much this can lead to faster training and larger batch sizes. For example, what is the new batch size that can be used, and how much speed up we gain? Some real-world numbers here could be beneficial.
* From Theorem 1, it looks like the AUTO algorithm obtains the same convergence speed compared to the standard SGD. However, the standard SGD does not require per-sample gradient to be symmetric about the oracle gradient as shown in Assumption 4.3. I wonder if this is critical for AUTO to get on-par convergence speed to SGD? What will the convergence rate be like without such assumption?

 The paper investigates the backpropagation in quantum models which is interesting and of general interest to the community of QML. It combines online learning and shadow tomography to achieve $O(polylog(M))$ sample complexity for gradient estimation.  1. Even though the proposed method achieves $O(polylog(M))$ of sample complexity, it also requires exponential classical resources which is not practical for handling a large system.
2. It only provides the theoretical analysis and does not give some proof-of-principle numerics.
3. Some necessary details and the related brief introduction of the proposed methods should be listed in the manuscript instead of supplementary.
 1. In proposition 7(193), as the variational model is defined as the trace of a quantum state, i.e. $tr\[U_\theta \rho U_\theta^\dagger\]$, the loss will always be constant 1, so no matter what $\theta$ we choose the gradient will always be 0, so it is confusing that what's the contribution of the gradient in such setting and whether in the general case, it also achieves $O(\frac{\log(M)}{\epsilon^4})$ backpropagation scaling. 
2. In the proof of theorem 12(281), As in definition 8, $\mathcal{U}(\theta)=e^{-i\theta_M P_M}\dots U_1$, why each parameter $\theta_i, i\in\[M\]$ associated with the same $P_i=Y_0\otimes Z_1$ and whether the first term in the Pauli string $P_i$ should not be $X_0$ when observable set as $Z_0$?
3. when we choose random Pauli strings $P_j$ and the initial setting of $\theta$ is NOT 0, whether the theorem 12 still holds?

While in the classical case we can use backpropagation, which gives the same linear scaling for computing the gradient and the forward pass, in the quantum case, we would naively have to run a circuit for each component of the gradient, leading to a squared complexity in the number of parameters, which prevents studying quantum models with large number $M$ of parameters.
The authors formulate this problem in the language of shadow tomography and apply ideas from that field to the problem at hand.
This shows that while an $M\log M$ scaling is possible using polylog copies of the input state. This comes at a drawback of classical cost that scales as $2^n$ with $n$ the number of qubits. Resolving this exponential scaling would resolve some open problems in shadow tomography. - Relevant problem in quantum ML.
- Connection with shadow tomography and application to scaling of gradient computation is new and can lead to new ways to think about the problem
- Rigorous statements supporting scaling 
- Well written paper - The paper relies on quantum information concepts that are not necessarily familiar with the ML audience at the conference.
- When talking about memory requirements of backprop in classical neural networks, one needs to store activations for reverse mode autodiff. This leads to memory that scales with the number of layers, while in the quantum case by analogy the number of qubits does not scale with the number of layers. The authors could comment about this.
- I was confused by Prop. 3: is the proof considering the case of a number of parameters $4^n$? I am not sure what we learn from this example since it does not seem to be part of the quantum neural networks we would like to train.
- The classical scaling as $2^n$ required for the proposed algorithm restricts a lot the class of problem for which this protocol can be useful. 
 - Can you add a related work section to highlight the novelty with respect to previous work?
- Can you explain what is rotate/threshold check in figure 1? Can you add more intuition around proposition 7 to see how gentle measurements are used, e.g. what is alpha in this case? What is the role of $\sigma$? 
- Can you comment on what problems could benefit from the proposed protocol, namely small $n$ and large $M$?
- Can you explain why approximations to $\sigma$ using for example tensor networks could be more robust than just simulating the quantum neural network with tensor network? - As the authors say several time, the main limitation is that their algorithm come with a classical exponential scaling that limits its applicability.

The comparison could contribute great value to the manuscript if additional parameters as listed below are included in it: Page 3: Right column: Line 4: The authors can address why they have selected only Hydroxyl radicals in the investigations. In some experiments, where UV rays are used to excite the organic aerosols, the elicitation of superoxide radicals is also possible.  Page 3: Right column: Lines 28-30: The statement “aerosol stream was sampled while a UV lamp was on, following a 90-minute reaction period.” is not clear. Does that mean the whole sample streaming is done for a continuous 90 minutes? Was it the same for the aerosol sampling done in dark OFR?  Page 3: Right column: Line 33: The information of the control sample needs to be included here.  Page 4: Left column: Line 23: The analysis part has some information missing such as incubation time for cell growth, and are the same generation (life cycle) used for analysis?  Page 4: Left column: Line 25: The cell exposure study has some basic information missing - PM dose, route of exposure (directly on filters or on PM extracts), number of times analysed (duplicate or triplicate). Please include for clarity.  Page 5: Figure 4: The biogenic organic compounds (for example: the alpha-pinene) are believed to be more hydrophilic compared to engine exhaust organics.

The evaluation is based on AlexNet, with the small-scale composite task created using Imagenette images (side-by-side or overlay, Sec 3.2) following experimental neuroscience protocols. + \[Originality\] The paper is sufficiently novel in my opinion, with key architectural features well motivated by experimental psychology & neuroscience evidence and reasonably different from existing RNN & predictive coding based architectures (Sec 5). - \[Clarity\] Although the overall writing is reasonably clear and easy to follow, the ambiguity in technical details renders accurate understanding of the paper impossible without digging into the source code. Examples are as follows.
1) How exactly are the modulatory pathways (Sec 2.2) and subsequent forward passes executed? E.g., in LRM1, is (Conv4 -> Conv1) executed after or concurrently with (Output -> Conv4)? Is the modulatory signal $f$ applied to e.g. $x$ from the initial pass or $x’$ from the first modulatory pass (i.e. $x’ + x*f$, or $x’(1+f)$)?
2) How exactly does the model (likely trained with 224x224 ImageNet images, Sec 2.3) handle both the overlay setting (same image size as training) and the side-by-side setting (2x image size) at the same time? 
3) AblationCam (Fig 3), output activation unit (Fig 6), $\sigma\pm$ (Sec 2.1), etc. are undefined.

- \[Quality\] Empirical evaluation (soundness) is the main issue of the paper. While the proposed composite task and dataset are likely acceptable in psychology & neuroscience papers, it’s unfortunately not really sufficient for conferences like NeurIPS in my opinion. I strongly suggest the authors include additional experiments on more standard (commonly seen) CV datasets, such as \[72, 73\] or ones from \[48-69\], and comparisons against (some) existing approaches \[48-71\] whether they’re mechanistically similar to this work or not.

- \[Significance\] Although the paper is sufficiently novel, given its non-negligible weaknesses in clarity and quality (soundness), it’s unfortunately hard to conclude that this work is significant (i.e. sufficiently promising). Brain-Score \[74\] could be a different direction to showcase the paper’s significance.

The authors find that the model with the feedback projection layers outperforms the baseline feedforward model in both the categorization performance and adversarial robustness. The model is further analyzed to test whether the feedback modulation can be controlled to meaningfully steer the representations. The authors find that the top-layer steering yields significant performance increase when mixed targets are presenting in the same image in a side-to-side or overlaying fashion. The paper is well-written and easy to read. The significant improvement of the feedback-augmented model compared to the baseline model is also interesting. The steering analysis is done on both side-to-side and overlaying settings. The idea of adding feedback modulation from top layers to earlier layers is not new. The authors should more clearly discuss the difference between their work and other models.

The performance and robustness evaluation also needs to be more careful. The feedback connection adds more computation and trainable parameters. But the performance is still compared to the baseline model with less computation and trainable parameters. The authors should compare their model to a larger or deeper architecture.

Although the steering analysis shows that the model can reach higher performance, this analysis is kind of circular as the target signal is explicitly used to generate the modulation signal, which makes the performance improvement unsurprising. This steering property of the new model has its potential, as the proposed visual model is now available to be tested in attention experiments just as how humans can be asked to attend to different parts or features in their input.

 * The paper lacks benchmarking. There are several methods of incorporating feedback in deep learning models from previous years that weren't tested. Look at \[1\] for a survey. Although I am sympathetic about this since cognitive steering in itself is interesting but the paper needs to be clear that the contributions are in studying various steering methods/signals and not introducing feedback itself. 

* Side-by-side composition is not a straightforward task setting - putting images side by side reduces the scale of the objects and since CNNs are not scale invariant that poses a challenge. So I am not quite convinced it is a good test for steering.

The paper proposes a unified end-to-end Federated Learning (FL) framework for Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) named FedAIoT. The framework is benchmarked across multiple IoT datasets and incorporates a variety of data partitioning schemes, preprocessing techniques, models, and FL hyperparameters. Despite its comprehensive approach, the paper lacks a comparative study with existing state-of-the-art solutions. Moreover, while the paper mentions the inclusion of popular schemes and models in its framework, it doesn't substantiate why these were chosen over other potential candidates.

Equations and Mathematical Formulations
The paper briefly touches upon the Dirichlet distribution for creating non-IID data partitions and mentions metrics like accuracy and Mean Average Precision (MAP-50). However, it lacks mathematical rigor. For instance, the Dirichlet distribution is mentioned but not defined. A formal definition, perhaps along with its probability density function, would have given more depth. Furthermore, there are no equations to represent the FL optimizers like FedAvg and FedOPT, which makes it difficult to appreciate the nuances or compare them.

Tables and Figures
Table 1: While useful for a cursory comparison, this table lacks depth. For example, it could include a comparison based on performance metrics to provide an analytical foundation for its claims.

Figure 1 and 2: These figures provide an overview but lack detail. For example, Figure 2 could be improved by including the types of IoT-specific preprocessing techniques or by detailing the architecture of the proposed IoT-friendly models.

Table 4: This table summarizes the performance metrics but lacks confidence intervals or p-values, which are essential for ascertaining the statistical significance of the results.

Table 5: While this table attempts to show the impact of client sampling ratios, it doesn't explain why only two ratios (10% and 30%) were chosen for comparison.

Dataset and Experimental Design
The paper includes a wide range of datasets, which is commendable. However, it doesn't provide any rationale for the specific choice of datasets. Furthermore, no information is given about the train-test split methodology. Was it random or stratified? The partitioning schemes for these datasets are discussed, but there is a lack of empirical justification for why these schemes are effective or superior to existing methods.

Algorithms and Techniques
The paper discusses various FL optimizers, data partitioning schemes, and IoT-friendly models, but there is a lack of justification for the chosen methods. For example, why were FedAvg and FedOPT selected as FL optimizers? Are they computationally less expensive or do they converge faster?

Results and Discussion
The paper presents a broad range of results but lacks a discussion comparing these results to existing benchmarks or state-of-the-art methods. The paper would benefit from including such a comparative analysis.

Insufficient Empirical Validation
The experiments conducted are somewhat limited in scope and scale. Only a few datasets are considered, and they seem to belong to similar domains. This raises questions about the model's generalizability. Moreover, the paper lacks ablation studies, making it difficult to understand the contribution of each component of the proposed method.

Actionable Insight: Include a broader array of datasets from varying domains to validate the model. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of each component or parameter.

Absence of Comparative Analysis
While the paper aims to introduce a novel methodology, there is an absence of a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods. Without this, the paper falls short of convincingly establishing the proposed method's superiority or novelty.

Actionable Insight: Include comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative terms. This could be in the form of performance metrics, computational efficiency, or even qualitative assessments based on real-world applicability.

Mathematical Rigor
The paper would significantly benefit from a more rigorous mathematical treatment of the proposed algorithm. Currently, it seems to rely more on empirical observations. Given your stated goals of developing proper mathematical models, this is an area that requires attention.

Actionable Insight: Introduce formal proofs or derivations that can substantiate the algorithm's properties, such as stability, convergence, or robustness. Include theoretical justifications for the choices made in the algorithm's design.

Lack of Discussion on Limitations
Every model has its limitations, and acknowledging them not only adds credibility but also helps in guiding future work.

Actionable Insight: Devote a section to discuss the limitations of the proposed method and potential avenues for future research. Data Assumptions: Could the authors clarify the specific assumptions made about the data distribution? How do these assumptions align with the real-world scenarios where the model is expected to be deployed?

Methodological Choices: What was the rationale behind the selection of specific hyperparameters and architectural elements in the proposed model? Some clarification on this could strengthen the paper's methodological grounding.

Evaluation Metrics: The paper uses a particular set of metrics for evaluation. Could the authors elucidate why these metrics are most suitable for assessing the model's performance? Are there any other metrics that were considered but not used?

Computational Complexity: How does the computational complexity of the proposed method compare with existing state-of-the-art methods? Could the authors provide a detailed analysis in this regard?

Scalability: The paper does not discuss how well the proposed method scales with the size of the dataset. Could the authors provide insights or supplementary experiments that address this?

Ablation Study: The absence of an ablation study leaves some questions about the necessity of each component of the proposed model. Could the authors provide such an analysis in the rebuttal or an extended version of the paper?

Theoretical Guarantees: Are there any theoretical guarantees, such as convergence or bounds, that can be associated with the proposed algorithm? If yes, this would be a valuable addition to the paper.

Limitations: Every model has its shortcomings. Could the authors elucidate the limitations of the proposed model and how they plan to address these in future work?",1480,0,0,0.8076,0.0647396694,0.8674352765000001,49,18.1151,0.1211,iclr,0.0,2,4,4,2,factual,4,2,40,polite,3,positive,4,moderate,5,4,5,5,factual,5,5,85,polite,5,neutral,5,moderate,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,factual,4.0,4.0,80.0,polite,5.0,neutral,3.0,low,5,5,5,5,factual,5,5,95,polite,5,neutral,5,none,5,4,4,4,factual,4,4,88,polite,5,neutral,5,low

The contributions include the curation of eight (already available) datasets spanning different applications and modalities, an end-to-end FL framework for AIoT, some novel ideas on handling noisy labels and extending quantized training to the client side. The main strengths and contributions of the paper are the following:

1) The limitation of existing benchmark datasets in their application to IoT applications is a real one, and the contribution of this paper is curating important publicly available datasets to create a single benchmark for evaluating FL algorithms is an important step.

2) The important FL issues of noisy labels in classification tasks and quantized training due to the resource constraint of IoT devices has been addressed. The paper has the following weaknesses:

1) Although the paper does well in introducing a new benchmarking framework for FL for IoT, it still largely builds upon curating from existing datasets introduced by prior works.

2) The introduced end-to-end FL framework also seems to be a collection of standard machine learning and FL ideas such as non-IID data partitioning, normalization, etc. The novel contributions of addressing noisy labels (non uniform addition of noise) and quantized training at the client side seem limited.

3) The discussion on the details of non-IID partitioning using Dirichlet allocation seems limited, with no further details provided either in the main paper or in the supplementary material. Below are some comments and questions:

1) The authors mention that in real-life settings, individuals may not carry a smartphone and wear a smartwatch at the same time, and hence WISDM dataset was partitioned into two.

161,Anne-Thessen,Reuse of the FoodOn Ontology in a Knowledge Base of Food Composition Data,"We describe our work to integrate the FoodOn ontology with our knowledge base of food composition data, WikiFCD. WikiFCD is knowledge base of structured data related to food composition and food items. With a goal to reuse FoodOn identifiers for food items, we imported a subset of the FoodOn ontology into the WikiFCD knowledge base. We aligned the import via a shared use of NCBI taxon identifiers for the taxon names of the plants from which the food items are derived. Reusing FoodOn benefits WikiFCD by allowing us to leverage the food item groupings that FoodOn contains. This integration also has potential future benefits for the FoodOn community due to the fact that WikiFCD provides food composition data at the food item level, and that WikiFCD is mapped to Wikidata and contains a SPARQL endpoint that supports federated queries. Federated queries across WikiFCD and Wikidata allow us to ask questions about food items that benefit from the cross-domain information of Wikidata, greatly increasing the breadth of possible data combinations.

138,Reviewer-z7DA,Parameter-Efficient Tuning Helps Language Model Alignment,"Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is essential for safe and useful LLMs. Previous works mainly adopt reinforcement learning (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) with human feedback for alignment. Nevertheless, they have certain drawbacks. One such limitation is that they can only align models with one preference at the training time (e.g., they cannot learn to generate concise responses when the preference data prefers detailed responses), or have certain constraints for the data format (e.g., DPO only supports pairwise preference data). To this end, prior works incorporate controllable generations for alignment to make language models learn multiple preferences and provide outputs with different preferences during inference if asked. Controllable generation also offers more flexibility with regard to data format (e.g., it supports pointwise preference data). Specifically, it uses different control tokens for different preferences during training and inference, making LLMs behave differently when required. Current controllable generation methods either use a special token or hand-crafted prompts as control tokens, and optimize them together with LLMs. As control tokens are typically much lighter than LLMs, this optimization strategy may not effectively optimize control tokens. To this end, we first use parameter-efficient tuning (e.g., prompting tuning and low-rank adaptation) to optimize control tokens and then fine-tune models for controllable generations, similar to prior works. Our approach, alignMEnt with parameter-Efficient Tuning (MEET), improves the quality of control tokens, thus improving controllable generation quality consistently by an apparent margin on two well-recognized datasets compared with prior works.","The paper proposes MEET, a method to train a LLM to generate ""good"" and ""bad"" answers to a given question / task by conditioning the model computation with an adapter (LoRA or Soft Prompt). To do so, they adopt a two-step training procedure. First, they train a ""good control adapter"" and a ""bad control adapter"" on good answers and bad answers respectively while keeping the base LM fixed, then they fine-tune both the control adapters and the base model. The authors show that this two step procedure is important to achieve gains over the Chain of Hindsight baseline (basically a baseline where control adapters is just a handcrafted prompt ""A good/bad conversation is:"") and DPO on two datasets OpenAI Summary and HH-RLHF from Anthropic. - The paper is well-written, the details of the experimental setting are clear.
- The two-stage training procedure is interesting and its importance is validated by the ablation study.
- Results seem to suggest that the two-step optimization method delivers gains w.r.t. DPO. - It feels like the authors are a bit confused on where the novelty of their paper really lies, they seem to suggest that it is in using adapters to control generation, but imho, the interesting bit is more on the two-step training procedure that guarantees information is captured by the adapters and thus they are not ""information-starved"" by the full LM fine-tuning (easy to fix)

- The more problematic bit is that authors' confusion seems to have affected the overall experimental methodology; for example, the authors seem to tie their method to the specific loss function used (i.e. MLE) and compare to DPO, while their method can be used on top of DPO. Moreover, the baselines numbers are a bit concerning and some important baselines are missing (overall harder to fix) About novelty:

The paper proposes to learn ""attributes"" conditional models with adapters, which have been proposed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08453.pdf for diffusion models for example. So, here, the novelty might reside in 1/ applying this general idea to textual generation tasks and 2/ the two-stage training approach proposed to train these adapters. The current stance of the paper is that the main novelty is to apply LoRA adapters for generation instead of hard prompts. I feel like 2/ is a more interesting and impactful contribution but currently it is a bit understated in the paper, so it feels like it should be the central focus of the paper. I feel like the paper can be an interesting set of experiments showing that the two-stage approach prevent adapters from being ""information-starved"" from full model fine-tuning.

About experiments:

Confusion about the contributions seem to appear in Section 3, where the authors tie their method to MLE loss (1) and (2) and compare in the experiments with a DPO baseline. This is a bit surprising to me given that their method can be deployed on top of DPO, i.e. Eq (1) and (2) can use DPO instead of MLE (to train each good and bad expert), so I am not sure why DPO would be a baseline in the experiments. On the contrary, I would have expected to see two versions of their method in the experiments: with Eq. (1) and (2) using DPO (MEET-DPO) and Eq. (1) and (2) using MLE (MEET-MLE).

From all experiments, one straightforward baseline is missing in addition to CoH: SFT -- which just trains on positive data.

Similarly, for MEET-MLE, what is the impact of integrating negative data? i.e. what is the gap between MEET-SFT, which just trains the controllable adapter of positive data and MEET-MLE, which trains on both positive and negative data with Eq. 2?

In the first dataset, DPO underperforms CoH on OpenAI/Summary dataset. The fact that DPO underperforms CoH on this dataset is a bit suspicious. Did you tune the \beta parameter for DPO on both datasets ?

How do you do cross-validation in these two datasets? Are you searching for the best HPs for each method on the validation set?

Taken together, your results currently show that DPO is useless in these two datasets and severely underperform MLE training with MEET. I am not sure this result can be published without further ablations and baselines as I suggest above, especially it appears to me that MEET can be further improved with DPO training.

2. It studies several aspects of the proposed method such as prompt length, rank, and temperature. 1. This paper conducted several experiments. However, I don't think the baselines the paper compares with are sufficient. Several works focus on a similar idea about incorporating the reward into text learning, such as RLPrompt \[1\] and AutoPrompt \[2\]. Those should become the baselines to compare the method proposed in the paper. Also, For controllable text generation, there is an interesting direction to utilize the diffusion process, such as the Diffusion-LM \[3\]. However, none of these are included and compared in the paper. Thus, I am not convinced with the experimental results shown in the paper.

2. The performance of the proposed method does not show enough improvements compared to the baseline mentioned in the paper. It highly correlates to the hyperparameter settings. It would be good to include the detailed ablations of those hyperparameters. 

3. The proposed method seems to be not novel. We know the impact of LoRA, and the proposed method seems just a direct implementation of the LoRa with parameter-efficient tunning with some specific designs. Could authors provide more justification about the novelty of the proposed methods?

4. For the ablation section, what would be the efficiency comparison between the proposed method and the baselines? Such as the running time and computation latency.

17,Reviewer-dK5u,Beyond Size: How Gradients Shape Pruning Decisions in Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) with a billion or more parameters are prime targets for network pruning, which aims to reduce a portion of the network weights without compromising performance. Prior approaches such as Weights Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda, either concentrated solely on weights or integrated weights with activations for sparsity. However, they overlooked the informative gradients derived from pretrained large language models. In this paper, we present a novel sparsity-centric pruning method for pretrained LLMs, termed **G**radient-**b**ased **L**anguage **M**odel **P**runer (**GBLM-Pruner**). Distinctively, GBLM-Pruner operates in a training-free manner by harnessing normalized gradients, and substantially outperforms competitive counterparts like SparseGPT and Wanda in multiple benchmarks. Intriguing, after incorporating gradients, the unstructured pruning method tends to reveal some structural patterns post-pruning, which mirrors the geometric interdependence inherent in the LLMs' parameter structure. Additionally, GBLM-Pruner functions without any subsequent retraining or weight updates to maintain its simplicity as other counterparts. Extensive evaluations on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 across various language benchmarks and perplexity show that GBLM-Pruner surpasses magnitude pruning, Wanda (*weights+activations*), and SparseGPT (*weights+activations+weight update*) by significant margins. Our code and models will be publicly available.","This study introduces GBLM-Pruner, a gradient-based approach for the unstructured pruning of large language models (LLMs). The core idea of this research is centered around a Taylor expansion applied to the loss function. This method estimates the change in loss by employing a combination of first-order gradient and second-order approximation (OBD). Empirical evaluations using LLaMA and LLaMA-2 demonstrate that GBLM-Pruner outperforms other methods such as magnitude pruning, SparseGPT, and Wanda in terms of performance. 1. This paper highlights the significance of gradients in the pruning of large language models (LLMs). The author presents a Taylor-based approach to identify critical parameters, yielding favorable outcomes in comparison to earlier techniques.
2. The work sets robust benchmarks by contrasting the proposed methods with various existing baselines, offering valuable insights for the research community. 1. To my knowledge, SparseGPT is similarly a gradient-based approach, utilizing Taylor expansion and second-order Hessian for estimating parameter importance. In light of this, the contribution of the current work may appear somewhat constrained.
2. As depicted in Figure 2, SparseGPT, Wanda, and the newly introduced GBLM-Pruner exhibit closely comparable results, with only minor differences in Perplexity (PPL). There isn't compelling evidence to suggest that GBLM-Pruner significantly outperforms its predecessors.
3. It would be beneficial if the author could include data on the latency of the pruned LLMs, particularly in the context of 2:4 sparsity acceleration.

3. The paper is well-written, offering clarity and ease of understanding in its presentation. 1. The novelty of this method appears somewhat constrained. Utilizing the first-order gradient for determining parameter importance is a common approach in pruning techniques applied to CNN, BERT, and ViT. This technique is well-established within the realm of model pruning. Considering in some instances this method even falls short of those achieved by SparseGPT (e.g., 2:4 for LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2), I cannot say the first-order gradient in pruning LLMs might be a major contribution.
2. This paper lacks experiments on different LLM families. Conducting trials with models like OPT, BLOOM, or other alternatives could provide valuable insights into the method's applicability and generalizability across various LLM families.
3. The paper doesn't provide details regarding the latency of the pruned model. In a study centered on LLM compression, including latency metrics is crucial since such information is highly important  to the readers to understand the efficiency of the pruned model. 1.

* Source code is provided, aiding reproducability. * Integrating gradient information into pruning criteria is a well studied area, see for example \[1, 2, 3, 4\]. This is currently not discussed under Related Work.
* Consequently, the novelty of GBLM is quite limited. For instance, the analysis in Section 2.3 is very similar to derivations presented in \[2\]. Ultimately, GBLM seems to be a minor variation of a diagonal Fisher scheme (using both gradients and activations while slightly tweaking norms in a heuristic manner).
* The most robust form of evaluation, perplexity, shows only very slight improvements relative to prior work of < 0.1 points, while dropping noticably from the baseline. I am not sure if this is a significant enough improvement in practice.
* It is unclear how the gradient calculation impacts the speed and compute/memory requirements of the pruning process. Being fast and memory efficient is one of the key strengths of SparseGPT and Wanda, hence I think a detailed comparison/discussion of this aspect would be important.

The authors provide both theoretical rationale and empirical assessments that demonstrate GBLM-Pruner outperforms other prominent baselines, such as Wanda and SparseGPT. - The paper is well-organized, effectively presenting the method with clear descriptions and comprehensive empirical evaluations.
- Both theoretical explanations and empirical results are presented to validate the theoretical explanations and empirical results.
- The paper includes plenty of ablation studies, encompassing diverse sparsity levels, different pruning metrics, assessments of dependency on calibration samples, and visualizations that highlight the specifics of sparse patterns. - The improvements achieved by GBLM-Pruner, as compared to other baselines like SparseGPT and Wanda, appear to be relatively modest. For instance, in Table 2, under 50% unstructured sparsity, GBLM-Pruner (l1) yields perplexity reductions of only 0.06, 0.09, and 0.05 compared to Wanda on LLaMA-2-7B/13B/70B, respectively. Additionally, in Figure 2, the curves for Wanda and GBLM-Pruner exhibit significant overlap.
  
- I'm unclear about the rationale behind experimenting with the pruning metrics listed in Line 7/8. It seems that some of these metrics may not provide meaningful insights.

- It's essential to understand the memory and time requirements during the pruning process of GBLM-Pruner. Obtaining gradient information can impose a significant memory cost, and it may not be feasible to conduct this process in a layer-wise manner. Storing intermediate features for the backward process could further impact memory usage. Thus, it would be valuable to compare these memory and time requirements with those of other baseline methods for a more comprehensive assessment of GBLM-Pruner's practicality.

In a setting with multiple buyers, a buyer's expected value for an experiment may also depend on the information sold to others. We introduce the application of deep learning for the design of revenue-optimal data markets, looking to expand the frontiers of what can be understood and achieved.

In particular, different from existing analytic approaches, the proposed approach is based on (deep) learning to recover/discover market designs. They adopt and extend an existing RochetNet architecture to both single- and multi-buyer setting and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in recovering/discovering the market design. - The paper studies the problem of market design and it is relevant for data market.
- The proposed learning-based approach is interesting in that it can recover some analytic solutions.
- There are relatively extensive empirical results. - The motivation and justification of a (deep) learning-based approach can be made stronger.
    
    In lines 40-42, ""The difficulty of using analytical tools for this problem of data market design is highlighted by this example, and it remains an open problem to obtain theoretical results for richer multi-buyer settings. This motivates the need for computational approaches."" While it is perceived that analytic solutions are difficult, and computational approaches seem a viable alternative. Is it really necessary to use deep learning? In other words, are there less complex computational approaches that can be tried first or reasons why they would not work as well? 

    In particular, (how) can the assumption of i.i.d. samples from $\mathcal{P}$ for training the deep learning model be satisfied? It requires the type of the buyer (i.e., both belief and the $v$) to remain fixed throughout observing the signals. Does this assumption have conflicts with ""Upon receiving a signal, the buyers update their prior beliefs and choose an optimal action accordingly"" (lines 143-144)?


- The inline equations in the paper can break the flow of the writing and make it more difficult for the reader to catch the most important points.

    For instance, equations (1)-(4) are used to discuss (different variants of) incentive compatbility. It is not so clear which equation the reader should pay most attention to. Furthermore, it seems that equation (4) (i.e., ex post incentivie compatible) is not interpreted after the equation.

- Some experimental results can be difficult to interpret (or understand their significance), due to the lack of (existing) analytic characterization of optimum solution. 

    For instance, in lines 294-296, ""We are aware of no theoretical characterization of optimal data market designs when both $v$ and $\theta$ vary. In such cases, we can use RochetNet to conjecture the structure of an optimal solution."" As a result, it is not clear to the reader how to understand whether the proposed method is effective. It further goes to the first point regarding the motivation/justification of a learning based approach: There lacks a solution or ground truth (i.e., analytic optimum or approixmate optimum) to evaluate the approach. Hence, it seems appealing to first establish such a solution before a computational approach, otherwise, how to effectively evaluate the proposed computational approach?
 - In lines 20-22, ""... hold vast quantities of data about individuals. In turn, this has led to data markets, where information about an individual can be purchased in real-time to guide decision-making (e.g., LiveRamp, Segment, Bloomreach)."" This seems to hint at that the aforementioned companies are selling data about individuals, is it what it means?

- In lines 60-62, ""Further, we give a training method that enables the efficient reuse of computed interim allocations and payments from other samples to swiftly calculate the interim utility of misreporting, dramatically speeding up training."" Is this empirically or theoretically demonstrated, specifically about ""dramatically speeding up training""? What is it comparing against, in terms of speed of training?

- In line 122, ""The state of the world, $\omega$, is unknown and is drawn from a finite state space ... "" Is there an assumption on the distribution of this?

- In line 127, ""where each $v_i$ is drawn independently from a distribution $\mathcal{V}_i$"". What is the interpretation of $v_i$ and what does the distribution $\mathcal{V}_i$ depend on?

- In lines 137-138, it seems that the negative externality is in the form of decreasing payment for one buyer $i$ as the gain for some other buyers. In other words, if another buyer $j$ gains (in ex post payoff), this buyer $i$ ""loses"" (i.e., has a lower utility), is this correct? How should this be interpreted in an example? 

- In line 139, ""There is a data seller who observes the world state ... "" How to justify or realize this assumption that the actual world state is exactly known by the data seller?

- In line 159 (5-th bulletin point), ""$u_i(a,\omega, V_i, \theta_i)$"", is it meant to be $V_i$ or $v_i$?

- In line 192, ""... an unsupervised learning problem."" Is it referring to optimizing the softmax version of Equation (9)? If so, it looks more like an optimization problem (i.e., parametric fitting) instead of a learning problem. Often, unsupervised learning is to learn about the inter or intra structure of the data instead of to fit a functional form. Please help interpret why the loss function in line 222 is an unsupervised learning problem.

 - Typically in an optimization approach, if the objective is non-convex (or more complex), it is difficult to establish theoretical guarantees in terms of the optimality or quality of the final solution obtained. This is also mentioned by the authors in lines 374 - 375. The implication is that, it is difficult to obtained a principled understanding of how good the solution (i.e., learnt market design) is, obtained from the gradient-based optimization.

- With regard to lines 378-380, ""we return to where we started, and underline that markets for trading data about individuals raise a number of ethical concerns."" In light of the potential ethical concerns of data trading, a (deep) learning-based approach potentially makes it even more difficult to manage and parse the working mechanism of the data trading. As a result, such an approach can make it even more difficult to reliably/verifably address those concerns.

2. It considers the obedience of data buyers in the design. This makes the approach more practical.
3. The paper provides a sound analysis of Individual Rationality for the mechanism and payments. 1. The writing could be improved. Preliminaries could be better structured to explain essential terms like menu entry, signaling, state of the world, how the mechanism works, etc. Interpretations could be added after Lemmas and computation equations (e.g., (10)) to improve clarity.
2. The scales of the experiments are not large enough to be convincing. If larger experiments are not possible, challenges and limitations should be clearly stated. **Major**

1. Are there any references to support the assumptions made in the preliminaries section? For example, why is the matching utility payoff reasonable in data market design? How do you interpret that in the binary-state setting in the real world? How about a more complex non-binary setting?
2. For the single buyer setting Lemma 3.1, it is claimed that the mechanism is Incentive Compatible as it is agent optimizing. Why is it agent optimizing when the objective is to maximize the payment by the agents?
3. How to access the validity of the results from the networks when there is no analytical solution (more complex settings)? For example, for the price of 0.14 outputted for setting C, how do you know whether it is close to optimal? Also, could you provide a more intuitive interpretation of the price and results?
4. What are the challenges in conducting experiments on binary states, actions? Also, can you perform experiments on more than two buyers? Can the method be extended to much more complex scenarios with a large number of players, actions and states?

In such a setting, a mechanism designer with access to an unknown world state interacts with buyers who have private types, and need to take actions whose payoffs vary depending on the world state. These buyers purchase (in the single buyer case) or bid on (in the multi-buyer case) access to a signaling scheme which, given reports from the agents and the world state, sends a signal to the buyers (which without loss of generality can just be a recommended action). This mechanism, treated as a direct-revelation mechanism, needs to be both truthful (incentivizing honest reporting by the buyers) and obedient (once the buyers receive their signal, they should be incentivized not to deviate from the recommendation). Subject to those constraints (either Bayesian or ex post), the mechanism designer wants to maximize their revenue.

This problem shares some similarities to truthful revenue-maximizing auction design. In that domain, there has been recent progress using the tools of ""differentiable economics"" to approximately learn high-performing (and sometimes even provably optimal) auctions, in both single- and multi-bidder settings.

The authors apply very similar techniques to this data market problem. In single-buyer settings (as in auctions) they are able to ensure exact IC; for multi-buyer settings they use a Lagrangian during training to approximately enforce IC constraints. They experiment on a relatively wide variety of problem instances, reproducing known results, finding new optimal mechanisms, and conjecturing optimal mechanisms where they cannot find them. The paper comprehensively shows how to successfully apply differentiable economics to a new domain where it has not previously been applied. The authors are able to reproduce optimal mechanisms and find new ones, showing that their adaptation of these technique is in fact useful in producing novel results. This helps to further push these techniques towards being practically helpful tools for theorists and modelers. The network architectures here are essentially the same as those used in previous work for auctions, only adapted slightly for the data market setting. This is fine, but it does mean that from the perspective of differentiable economics, there is no novel methodological contribution.

The experiments appear to consider at most 2 buyers. While (as in the case of multi-parameter auctions) even selling to just two buyers may be a very challenging case, it would be more interesting to consider a slightly larger number of buyers. Can the method in fact scale to larger (even just 3-5 buyers) settings, or not? This should be discussed.

51,Reviewer-zvsA,Data Market Design through Deep Learning,"The  _data market design_ problem is a problem in economic theory to find a set of signaling schemes (statistical experiments) to maximize expected revenue to the information seller, where each experiment reveals some of the information known to a seller and has a corresponding price. Each buyer has their own decision to make in a world environment, and their subjective expected value for the information associated with a particular experiment comes from the improvement in this decision and depends on their prior and value for different outcomes. In a setting with multiple buyers, a buyer's expected value for an experiment may also depend on the information sold to others. We introduce the application of deep learning for the design of revenue-optimal data markets, looking to expand the frontiers of what can be understood and achieved. Relative to earlier work on deep learning for auction design, we must learn signaling schemes rather than allocation rules and handle  _obedience constraints_  &mdash; these arising from modeling the downstream actions of buyers &mdash; in addition to incentive constraints on bids.  Our experiments demonstrate that this new deep learning framework can almost precisely replicate all known solutions from theory, expand to more complex settings, and be used to establish the optimality of new designs for data markets and make conjectures in regard to the structure of optimal designs.","The authors present a novel approach to the problem of data market design, which seeks to find a set of signaling schemes, each revealing some of the information known to a seller and having a corresponding price, where the goal is to maximize expected revenue. Then, the authors introduce the application of a deep learning framework to the automated design of the data market. The paper discusses the importance of data market design and its potential applications in real-world settings, such as data marketplaces where sellers sell data to buyers for ML tasks. The authors demonstrate that their new learning framework can replicate known solutions from theory, expand to more complex settings, and establish the optimality of new designs. The paper also highlights some limitations of the approach, such as the need for interpretability of the mechanisms learned by the RegretNet approach for larger problems, the potential for local optima in non-convex problems, and the challenge of achieving exact incentive alignment in multi-buyer settings. + The paper presents a novel approach to the problem of data market design, which uses deep learning to automate the design of data markets.

+ The authors demonstrate that their new learning framework can almost precisely replicate all known solutions from theory, which shows that the approach is effective and reliable.

+ The paper shows that the new learning framework can be used to establish the optimality of new designs and conjecture the structure of optimal designs, which is a significant contribution to the field.

 + The paper acknowledges that for the approach to provide insights into the theoretically optimal design for larger problems, it will be important to provide interpretability to the mechanisms learned by the approach. However, the RegretNet approach used in the paper is not immediately interpretable, which limits its usefulness in this regard.

+ The paper notes that the approach uses gradient-based approaches, which may suffer from local optima in non-convex problems. This suggests that the approach may not always find the global optimum and may be limited in its ability to handle more complex problems.

+ The paper attains in the multi-buyer setting approximate and not exact incentive alignment, which leaves the question as to how much alignment is enough for agents to follow the intended advice of a market design. This suggests that the approach may not be able to achieve exact incentive alignment in all settings, which could limit its effectiveness.
 + Could you provide more details on how the RegretNet approach can be made more interpretable for larger problems? Are there any specific techniques or methods that could be used to achieve this?

+ Have you considered using other optimization techniques besides gradient-based approaches to address the potential for local optima in non-convex problems? If so, what are some alternative approaches that could be used?

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  First, the authors have to prove that this patient has Behcet’s Disease. For that, they have give the exact medical history of the patient. We know approximately when the patient started to have Neuro-psychiatric manifestations, but we don’t know when the oral ulcers started and how long after the genital ulcers appeared. Second, we have to know how long each attack of oral ulcer took to disappear. Then we have to know how long the duration between the two attacks was. Then after, we have to know how many ulcers appeared in each attack. Finally we have to know the exact clinical manifestations of the ulcers and their progression until their disappearance. The same has to be given for genital ulcers. It is primordial to remember that not any oral or genital ulcer is an aphthous ulcer, and only an aphthous ulcer can be used as a diagnostic criterion. There are many oral or genital ulcers that may resemble an aphthous lesion, to the eyes of a non-expert. It is why for case reports like this, a high definition picture of the lesion is essential to be sure of the nature of the lesion. Once it is accepted that the oral lesion is an aphthous lesion, the authors have to prove that the genital ulcers were also aphthous ulcers. Once the presence of oral and genital aphthous ulcers is proved, one can say that the patient may have a Behcet’s Disease, because the patient fulfills the International Criteria for Behcet’s Disease (the ICBD). However, as said before, the patient may not have Behcet’s Disease. To be sure, one has to not find any other reason for the presence of the symptoms together. When it is sure that the patient has Behcet’s Disease, one has to show that the neurological manifestations are related to Behcet’s Disease. A patient can have Behcet’s Disease and another neurological disease like Multiple Sclerosis. In this case, the patient refused an examination of the Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  The manuscript 'Case Report: A case of neurogenic bladder in the setting of Behçet's disease after an initial diagnosis of multiple sclerosis' is an interesting paper. However, I have some comments addressed below. The case report is a readable report on an interesting topic. However, the authors do not report on any vaginal child delivery nor do they mention the BMI of the patient. Both are risk factors for stress urinary incontinence. It is very possible that before the MMK a mixed urinary incontinence was present and in retrospect it is always easy to say that the previous physicians did not do a good job. The blaming distracts from the main important message that patients with a neurogenic bladder are different from patients without a neurogenic bladder. Both referring physicians and physicians who provided the irreversible surgical treatment were responsible for the patient. This means that also the general practitioner and neurologist should be informed and know to whom they send their patients to. On a regular basis we observe maltreatment because the referring physician did not care to refer his or her patient  specifically to an expert in the field. Some attention should be given to treatment with botulinum toxin and midurethral tapes, which were also around when the bladder augmentation was given.  Is the background of the case’s history and progression described in sufficient detail? Yes  Are enough details provided of any physical examination and diagnostic tests, treatment given and outcomes?

120,Peter-W.-Glynn,Multi-species consumer jams and the fall of guarded corals to crown-of-thorns seastar outbreaks,"Outbreaks of predatory crown-of-thorns seastars (COTS) can devastate coral reef ecosystems, yet some corals possess mutualistic guardian crabs that defend against COTS attacks. However, guarded corals do not always survive COTS outbreaks, with the ecological mechanisms sealing the fate of these corals during COTS infestations remaining unknown. In August 2008 in Moorea (17.539° S, 149.830° W), French Polynesia, an unusually dense multi-species aggregation of predators was observed feeding upon guarded corals following widespread coral decline due to COTS predation. Concurrent assaults from these amplified, mixed-species predator guilds likely overwhelm mutualistic crab defense, ultimately leading to the fall of guarded corals. Our observations indicate that guarded corals can sustain devastating COTS attacks for an extended duration, but eventually concede to intensifying assaults from diverse predators that aggregate in high numbers as alternative prey decays. The fall of guarded corals is therefore suggested to be ultimately driven by an indirect trophic cascade that leads to amplified attacks from diverse starving predators following prey decline, rather than COTS assaults alone.","Approved  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.

106,Reviewer-nNZN,Learning to Branch with Offline Reinforcement Learning,"Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) solvers are mostly built upon a branch-and-bound (B\&B) algorithm, where the efficiency of traditional solvers heavily depends on hand-craft heuristics for branching.  Such a dependency significantly limits the success of those solvers because such heuristics are often difficult to obtain, and not easy to generalize across domains/problems.  
Recent deep learning approaches aim to automatically learn the branching strategies in a data-driven manner, which removes the dependency on hand-crafted heuristics but introduces a dependency on the availability of high-quality training data. Obtaining the training data that demonstrates near-optimal branching strategies can be a difficult task itself, especially for large problems where accurate solvers have a hard time scaling and producing near-optimal demonstrations.  This paper overcomes this obstacle by proposing a new offline reinforcement learning (RL) approach, namely the \textit{Ranking-Constrained Actor-Critic} algorithm, which can efficiently learn good branching strategies from sub-optimal or inadequate training signals. Our experiments show its advanced performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency over previous methods for different types of MILP problems on multiple evaluation benchmarks.","The paper considers the problem of learning to select branching strategies while solving mixed integer programs via branch and bound algorithm. The key idea is to collect offline training dataset using full strong branching as behavior policy and learn an offline RL algorithm to generate the learned branching policy. Improvement of the dual bound is chosen as the reward function. Experiments are performed on four synthetic and two real world problems. - Using offline RL for branching policies seems like a natural idea that should do better than pure imitation learning. I am surprised that this wasn't tried earlier and commend the paper for making this simple but natural idea work well. 

- The description of the problem and solution is written clearly and easy to understand.

- The proposed approach performs well on multiple benchmarks. - A large part of the paper talks about sub-optimality of the FSB policy. For example, this statement ""Although FSB generally achieves high-quality branching, it could still become sub-optimal when the linear programming relaxation is uninformative or there exists dual degeneracy"" Is there more justified argument for this backed by some evidence?

- why choose the proposed algorithm over any existing offline RL algorithm like CQL\[1\], IQL etc.?

This advantage is particularly notable in reducing the time to collect datasets for training the models. The reported performance on the MIP instances also indicates the effectiveness of the framework. 1. **Innovative Formulation:** The novel formulation of L2B as an Offline RL approach using a sub-optimal dataset is a significant departure from traditional methods.
2. **Efficiency in Data Collection:** The framework requires significantly less time to collect its dataset, enhancing its practicality.
3. **Performance:** The proposed framework improved performance compared to the GGCN framework on smaller dataset sizes, which is commendable. Despite the novelty of the work, I have reservations about the robustness of its results. These concerns are expanded upon in this section and further detailed in the questions that follow. 

1. **Lack of Scaling-Generalization Results:** A key aim of collecting datasets on smaller instances is to develop policies that excel on larger, more complex instances. It would be beneficial to see how various models perform on scaled-up versions of instances in various problem categories like SC, MIS, CA, or CFL. How do these policies perform on Medium or Hard instances (scaled-up versions) in SC, MIS, CA, or CFL? Does RCAC retain its performance advantage on scaling up to larger instances?

2. **Insufficient Comparison with Existing Methods:** 
- The paper lacks a thorough comparison with recent advancements in the GGCN framework, particularly the augmented loss function introduced in ""Lookback for Learning to Branch"" (Gupta et al. 2022, https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14987). It would be insightful to see how RCAC compares to this improved GGCN variant. 
 - If I understand correctly, RCAC (S) and GGCN (S) primarily differ in their approach to training despite similarities in other aspects, such as dataset collection. Specifically, GGCN (S) employs a Cross-Entropy loss function, while RCAC (S) is focused on learning a Q-function (and a corresponding policy). The distinctiveness of the RCAC framework lies in its utilization of rewards instead of directly using FSB selections, as is the case with GGCN. However, an alternative comparison could involve integrating rewards into the GGCN framework as an additional signal. This could be achieved, for instance, by employing rewards to modulate the Cross-Entropy loss at each node, similar to how node depth might be used. Demonstrating RCAC's superior performance in this modified context would further reinforce the effectiveness of its RL-based approach as formulated in the study. 
    - It would be valuable to have the values of \( k \) specified for each model. I am particularly curious to know whether \( k > 1 \) for RCAC(S).
- Comparisons with other RL methods, especially in terms of dataset size and time efficiency, would also be valuable. Clarifications:

1. **Section 3.3:** Should ""representation of the B&B tree"" be replaced with ""representation of the B&B node"" for accuracy? 
2. **Training Dataset for GGCN (H) and RCAC (H):** Are these models trained on the same dataset? Is GGCN (H) trained on a separate dataset collected as specified in the Appendix?
3. **VHB Dataset Transitions:** Could the authors clarify what constitutes a 'transition' in this context? Does the transition include (s,a,s’) even when FSB is not employed in VHB, which is 0.05 times? Do you discard any transition? How is it ensured that you explore a wide array of instances before 100K transitions are collected?
4. **S Method Training:** Is the S method trained with only 5K transitions? 
5. **Reward Distribution:** Could the authors provide details on the distribution of reward values in the dataset, perhaps in the Appendix? Information on how this varies with tree depth and how normalization is handled would be valuable.
6. **Figure 3 Clarity:** What is the specific problem family represented in Figure 3?
7. **Practicality of H dataset collection:** Given that VHB takes longer than FSB (as indicated in column 2), is it still a practical choice since the performance is worse than S?
8. **GGCN Expansion:** Could the authors clarify the abbreviation GGCN? It seems to be a variation of GCNN (Graph Convolutional Neural Networks) as used in Gasse et al. 2019.
9. **Inference Procedure in RCAC:** Are there two forward passes $G_\omega\$ and $\pi_\phi$ during inference in RCAC? How does this differ from the inference process in GGCN?
10. **Hyperparameter \(k\):** Figure 3 suggests that \(k\) has a significant impact on RCAC's performance. Could the authors provide the \(k\) values used for each model and dataset?

11. **Aggregation in Table 4:** How are scores aggregated across 20 instances in Table 4? Assuming this is a cumulative sum, RCAC appears to outperform in WA but not against RPB in AP. Can the authors speculate on which problem types might be more amenable to improvement by RCAC?

12. **Reward Ablation:** Could the authors discuss the rationale behind choosing dual bound improvement over primal-dual gap improvement? Understanding the preference for one metric over the other would be enlightening.


Suggestions:
1. **Dataset Comparison:** I think it will be pretty helpful to have a section or a figure demonstrating the difference (transition vs. individual nodes) between the dataset collected using the standard IL methods and the one proposed in this work. 
2. **Statistical Significance:** Please include p-values to indicate the statistical significance of differences in Tables 2 and 3.
3. **Evaluation Methodology:** Given that 20 seems a relatively small sample size for testing, it's common practice to evaluate each instance with multiple seeds, as demonstrated in Gasse et al. 2019.

172,Reviewer-icwN,Structured Neural Networks for Density Estimation and Causal Inference,"Injecting structure into neural networks enables learning functions that satisfy invariances with respect to subsets of inputs. For instance, when learning generative models using neural networks, it is advantageous to encode the conditional independence structure of observed variables, often in the form of Bayesian networks. We propose the Structured Neural Network (StrNN), which injects structure through masking pathways in a neural network. The masks are designed via a novel relationship we explore between neural network architectures and binary matrix factorization, to ensure that the desired independencies are respected. We devise and study practical algorithms for this otherwise NP-hard design problem based on novel objectives that control the model architecture. We demonstrate the utility of StrNN in three applications: (1) binary and Gaussian density estimation with StrNN, (2) real-valued density estimation with Structured Autoregressive Flows (StrAFs) and Structured Continuous Normalizing Flows (StrCNF), and (3) interventional and counterfactual analysis with StrAFs for causal inference. Our work opens up new avenues for learning neural networks that enable data-efficient generative modeling and the use of normalizing flows for causal effect estimation.","The authors propose a novel method for constructing structured neural networks (strNN) that are able to respect causal independencies between variables.

The conditioned strNN are furthermore leveraged for conditioning autoregressive flow models. Practical application successfully is demonstrated over multiple synthetic datasets with comparisons between several baseline models, with and without the use of adjacency information. To the best of my knowledge related work is discussed sufficiently in the context of causal density estimation. 1. The authors propose a novel method for constructing structured models via weight masking that integrates seamlessly with existing neural architectures while respecting the strict independence assumptions of causal models. Preconditions and assumptions for application of the approach, specifically knowledge about the causal graph structure, are clearly stated.

2. To tackle the infeasibility of exact mask creation on larger graphs a greedy algorithm is proposed and its practical application is demonstrated.

3. The authors additionally include experiments on binary MNIST data, for which the underlying causal structure is unknown. By imposing a causal graph structure which promotes the usage of spatially local information, the authors improve performance for non-synthetic data over baselines. The example shown in Figure 1 decomposes the network into two separate networks. However, constructing the displayed a network would not require a complicated mask decomposition, but could be trivially solved by constructing two independent networks with constrained layer width. Only by inspecting the example provided in the appendix it is revealed that the presence of split-structures leads to shared weights between the outputs. 1. As causal mechanisms are often assumed to be independent in causal literature, I would like to ask the authors about the benefits or downsides of allowing for such shared weights within the network.

2. Furthermore, I would like to ask the authors to discuss possible simplifications for specific causal structures, e.g. in the case of independent causal mechanisms as seen in Figure 1.

Overall the idea is pretty good with a clever way of enforcing the causal independencies. However, all of this is assuming that the networks can leverage shared information between different mechanisms. If that is not the case then you could just train an independent density estimator for every single edge and (from a purely causal perspective) the problem becomes trivial to solve.

For instance, when learning generative models using neural networks, it is advantageous to encode the conditional independence structure of observed variables, often in the form of Bayesian networks. We propose the Structured Neural Network (StrNN), which injects structure through masking pathways in a neural network. The masks are designed via a novel relationship we explore between neural network architectures and binary matrix factorization, to ensure that the desired independencies are respected. We devise and study practical algorithms for this otherwise NP-hard design problem based on novel objectives that control the model architecture. We demonstrate the utility of StrNN in three applications: (1) binary and Gaussian density estimation with StrNN, (2) real-valued density estimation with Structured Autoregressive Flows (StrAFs) and Structured Continuous Normalizing Flows (StrCNF), and (3) interventional and counterfactual analysis with StrAFs for causal inference. Our work opens up new avenues for learning neural networks that enable data-efficient generative modeling and the use of normalizing flows for causal effect estimation.","In this paper, the authors present a neural network architecture that can fulfill the bayesian DAG conditional independencies needed for normalized density estimation.
In this work, the authors start from a binary lower adjacency matrix that encodes the independencies of a bayesian network DAG. Then they introduce a factorization of the global adjacency matrix into L adjacency matrices, which can be used as masks on each layer. This construction allows neural networks to be trained for a normalized density estimation task.
The authors introduce an heuristic to exactly factorize the adjacency matrix for the different layers using two objective functions.
With this building block the authors proceed to create a normalizing flow architecture that respects the independency restrictions end-to-end.  The authors then compare their approach empirically on different task against MADE, a neural density estimator that allows general dependencies for a given random variable ordering.  I found the paper insightful, and the results show that the approach is beneficial. The paper is technically sound and easy to read. The results showing an improvement in data efficiency for a given negative likelihood are also very interesting.

The introduction of the normalizing flow approach and the comparison in the causal setting are also nice additions that can have impact in the broader community.

The experiment on the sample quality shows the benefit of restricting the dependencies in the network as it cuts paths for noise in other random variables (and feature transformations) to propagate through the network. The major weakness of this paper is the limited empirical section in comparison to other papers in this domain. This can cause readers to wonder if the benefits of the new approach as density estimators are not significant for other datasets.
A broader comparison on other datasets would make the paper more robust. 

Also and I'm considering this as a minor weakness in my review, is that the method although insightful does not provide a way to obtain the global adjacency matrix.

 As I was reading the paper, my first thought would be that you would explore the possibility of discovering the dependencies for a given order. 
Here one can start with a dense adjacency matrix, train the network, clip nodes in the layers according to Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, and propagate the masks forward, i.e., multiplying all the masks to get the adjacency matrix. As you are clipping, the adjacency matrix is guaranteed to either be the same or introduce independencies. 
At that point, you can even use your factorization algorithm again to obtain a network with more/other nodes active while still respecting the new independencies. 
I'm wondering if you explored similar ideas during your research?
 The main limitations of the approaches presented are inherited from the restrictions on ordered models, e.g., marginalization and map queries are intractable for the general case. This is not mentioned in the paper.

For doing so, each layer of the neural network is masked and the product of the masks of all layers must be the same as the adjacency matrix of the DAG representing the Bayesian network. 
With this construction, the represented conditional dependencies with structured neural networks will be consistent with the given Bayesian network. The paper proposes a simple greedy algorithm to find the masks. It also proposes using the structured neural network to construct the coupling layers for normalizing flow and claims that the resulting generative model is better for casual inference (intervention and counterfactuals) than the prior approach.  The paper is well-written and the contribution towards causal inference is solid.   1- The structured neural network augments MADE with a better mask construction algorithm such that the factorization can be defined for any DAG structure. However, it is not a fundamentally different model.
2- The paper didn't propose any approach for learning the structure of DAG given the provided structured neural network parametrization.
3- MADE is not a strong density estimator and comparing only to MADE does not validate the strength of structured neural networks as density estimators. 
  1) How GNF would compare to StrAF if it does permute the latent variables after the first step? 
2) During the comparison with CAREFL did you provide CAREFL with external DAG orders that StrAF uses? If not, the learned causal order by CAREFL may not exactly specify the underlying DAG, which may result in lower performance in causal inference.

Although the article is quite short it provides all the essential information about the BioJS component for KEGG pathway visualization and points interested users to the source code for its implementation.  We do however have some minor comments about the text:The emphasis of signaling pathways is not reasoned enough in the text. KEGG has signaling pathways, but it is so much more (e.g. metabolism, information processing, diseases, etc). For the usage of the given component it makes no difference between pathway classification, this should be clarified.KEGG also has information about metabolites but this has not been mentioned in the text nor in the documentation of the component. I would assume that KEGGViewer is capable of handling metabolite data as well, but it would be nice to have it specified in the text and/or in the documentation of the component.Although KEGGViewer is an easy plugin for visualizing KEGG pathways it is not a unique way for visualizing user data and alternative options could be mentioned in the Introduction section.

Other alternatives that could be mentioned include Reactome, which allows expression analysis from user provided data.Although the BioJS KEGGViewer component page has enough information to create working examples of the component, not all the requirements are self-explanatory (missing UI icons, display problems on certain mac chrome versions, expression range setup bar is confusing and it could be set to a default state at 0,0, the proxy setup is confusing and needs better documentation).Currently, the description of parameters and options allows only basic usage.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  The BioJS library of components has a lot of potential. It's encouraging to see a diversity of interactive viewers already registered with BioJS. The intersection of modern JavaSript (JS) components with network biology in particular is ripe for development to bring powerful perspectives on massive biomedical datasets to researchers. I decided to critique this article introducing the BioJS KEGGViewer from three points of view to acknowledge the broad set of use cases and challenges this work takes on. While there are a number of things to improve upon (as always) and a few points requiring clarification, the project is a nice addition to the BioJS library and may provide a useful data visualization option when deployed with a complementary set of web tools for selecting pathways, managing datasets and viewing details.Generic User:The ""play"" feature is great for comparing conditions. Nicely done!Panning is tricky, I seem to have to hold cmd, click, pause, and then drag. Without the 'pause' I invoke a selection tool.There is no additional information or link-outs when you click on a node; only the gene symbol is provided.There is no interface for accessing the data values underlying the visualization. There is a disconnect between the web developer who sets up the viewer with all the underlying expression data and the end-user who views the data with only limited access and controls.Biomedical Researcher:The default expression range appears to be set at min-min, which results in all data values visualized as up-regulation. I would recommend default values centered on 0 in addition to support for user-provided parameters.Unfortunately, the parameter names and value ranges for data overlays are unnecessarily restricted to ""expression"", ""upColor"" and ""downColor"". A generic solution for data overlay that could work with any type of data (KEGGViewer shouldn't care if it's expression or not) and color gradients or discrete mapping options would be much more useful.All of these sorts of options are in fact already available in closely related tools (also free and open source, and which I happen to work on) that the authors neglected to cite: PathVisio [1] and Cytoscape [2]. These projects have both Java and JavaScript flavors. The JS version of Cytoscape was obviously used and cited in this work, but the Java version with its built-in data import, style and overlay options -- as well as KEGG import -- was missed. Speaking of KEGG, I'm dubious about the blanket statement that it is ""free of charge for academics"". It's a complicated situation that I know many colleagues are unclear about, so I think it's important to describe it thoroughly. According to their own website [3], ""Academic users who utilize KEGG for providing academic services are requested to obtain a KEGG FTP subscription for organizational use, which includes a proper license agreement."" This leads to a licensing agent with various paid subscription options [4,5]. The KEGG API, which KEGGViewer uses, is indeed freely provided for academic use, but only for individual downloads. Bulk downloads, such as those required to do analysis of over representation or enrichment, are explicitly forbidden and require a KEGG FTP subscription [6].Software Developer:It is unfortunate that the EBI host site has resources in conflict with the KEGGViewer. This seems counter to the whole point of BioJS and should be addressed in future releases of the EBI web site, cytoscape.js and/or KEGGViewer (whichever CSS is the most intrusive or classes least specific).Beyond a bit of copy/paste JS (including a 5-level deep JS object), asking users to host a php proxy will likely turn some away.

It addresses the problem of CLIP being insensitive to different mask proposals and tending to produce similar predictions regardless of the variation in proposals.

Instead of processing each mask individually, the proposed modified CLIP considers all mask proposals simultaneously, thereby reducing computational costs. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baselines by a significant margin.  - The proposed method is designed as a plug-and-play approach, making it applicable to any frozen CLIP-based method.
- The proposed method consistently improves the performance of baseline methods, including SegFormer, ZSSeg, and FreeSeg, by substantial margins, particularly on unseen classes.
- The method significantly reduces the computational requirements of CLIP in FreeSeg, and the effectiveness of the proposed mask-aware loss and IP-CLIP is demonstrated through ablation studies.
 - The starting point of the mask attention layer L is determined by a user-defined hyperparameter. The proposed method specifically employs ViT-B/16 as the backbone in the paper. However, if a different backbone is utilized, the selection of this hyperparameter would necessitate a hyperparameter search.

The core of the approach is the so-called IP-encoder that uses as input a frozen mask generator, as well as two losses, a mask-aware loss and a distillation loss The general idea is good and on a high-level the components (IP-CLIP encoder, mask aware loss and CLIP distillation) make sense to me

The reported results are good across three prior baselines and different datasets In my view the paper is not well written and important details are either not well motivated or even unclear (see below)

The paper reads to a large extend like an engineering paper with a few changes here and there to adapt to the task as hand. I would assume that to be not so interesting for the majority of NeurIPS Here are my main questions about writing

1) A^c is defined to be of dimension NxC (line 119) - with N the number of mask proposals
in the self-distillation loss however, figure 2 is showing a cx1 dimensional vector?
in any case I am confused as standard CLIP (here used as teacher) would not generate a NxC dimensional 
map - and thus A^C_{fro} in equation (7) does not seem to make sense to me - can you please explain?

2) related to that: in figure 2 it seems that the final projection from IP-CLIP encoder is used without biases? (w.o. B) - that seems quite obscure to me actually - what is meant? 

3) the mask-aware loss seems sensible on a high-level - but the details are not really motivated well. E.g. the reason for normalizing the IoU scores is unclear (equation 5)  - similarly the reason behind the exact formulation of equation 6 remain unclear. 

4) the paper uses L layers prior to condition on the masks, and 12-L after that. While there is an experimental ablation about this why would that make sense intuitively?

if the authors can clarify these points I will consider upgrading my score.

Given these inherent limitations, the authors argue that LLM censorship should be addressed more as a security problem than a machine learning problem. - Trendy topic
- A novel perspective to study LLM censorship - Implications can be extended
- Readability can be improved In this paper, the authors first focus on the semantic censorship mechanisms, proving that the current mechanisms cannot reliably detect if LLM output is ""semantically impermissible."" They further show that such limitations are inherent and can extend beyond semantic censorship mechanisms by designing Mosaic prompts.

Overall, the authors study a trendy topic and offer a novel perspective to understand LLM censorship. However, I have the following concerns.

- The authors prove the impossibility of semantic censorship using string transformation by showing how the transformed string might break the ""invariance of semantic censorship."" Here, I have some doubts regarding the invariance property. In my opinion, the semantics of a string often change after the transformation. Thus, it is reasonable for the transformed string to bypass semantic censorship mechanisms. Moreover, LLMs do not necessarily output harmful texts with the transformed string. Why does the invariance property hold? Is this property an important goal considered by LLM censorship developers when designing their mechanisms?

- Implications can be extended. It appears to me that the current implication discussion stops at showing LLM censorship is more of a security problem than a machine learning problem. What are the direct implications for model developers when building censorship? Are there any defensive measures against the Mosaic prompts? The authors only briefly mention that there are standard approaches, such as access controls and user monitoring, to build censorship from the security view. However, there is no further analysis showing that these approaches can indeed overcome the theoretical limitations of current external censorship mechanisms and surpass them in censorship performances.

- Readability can be improved. Many sentences are too long and difficult to read. For example, ""Thus, we can understand censorship as a method of determining permissibility of a string and censorship mechanisms can be described as a function, f(x), restricting the string x to the set of permissible strings P by transforming it to another string x' ∈ P if necessary, e.g. x' ='I am unable to answer.'""",394,0,0,0.787,0.0838709677,0.8256777525000001,47,29.8058,0.1199,iclr,0.0196078431372549,2,4,2,2,factual,3,4,60,neutral,3,neutral,2,moderate,4,3,4,4,partially factual,4,4,75,polite,5,neutral,4,moderate,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,factual,4.0,4.0,70.0,polite,5.0,neutral,3.0,low,3,3,4,4,factual,4,4,80,polite,5,neutral,4,low,2,3,3,4,partially factual,3,3,70,polite,5,neutral,4,low

But the paper contributes little of practical value. It also lacks a proper evaluation to claims and conceptual illustrations. The theoretical treatment would be interesting, but the paper claims are mostly direct implications of existing theorems or require minor enhancements. Overall, the contribution appears marginal.

Details:
* abstract:  LM -> LLM or define it.
*  The example, Figure 1 is not of any practical value and might be conceptually it is flawed - the three steps are the least challenge in making successful ransomware attack (deploying it is much more of an issue, avoiding being detected too). The Mosaic prompt is also not very convincing. Both should be shown to be actually working.
* The idea to use encryption (Appendix A) is interesting, but is this a practical concern? Does it add to the discussion of how protection mechanisms can be circumvented? It might, if it was shown to work. But as is, it seems incomplete.
* On a high level, the paper argues that censorship cannot work because a malicious person might not directly asked for censored actions, but for steps needed for these actions, which might not be censored. But this holds for almost anything in our world and is nothing new. Any technological knowledge can be abused.  A knife can be used to kill or to save a life (doctor during surgery).  A motor can power an ambulance saving life or a truck performing a terrorist act. This is general knowledge. The paper seems to sell this as a novel aspect. The fundamental question is: Should knowledge and technology be made available that can be abused?  This is also not really a security question as the paper argues. Obviously any abuse relates to security, but I don't see, why the paper's claim to say ""LLM censorship (ie. avoiding censorship through attacks) is a security concern"" should be a new insight. see above see above see above",346,0,1,0.7665000000000001,0.0904969069,0.7391343713,47,52.9766,0.0291,iclr,0.0306122448979592,2,3,3,2,unfactual,2,2,60,neutral,4,negative,2,high,3,3,3,2,partially factual,3,3,55,impolite,4,negative,4,moderate,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,partially factual,3.0,2.0,60.0,neutral,4.0,negative,4.0,low,2,3,3,2,partially factual,3,3,50,neutral,4,negative,3,moderate,2,4,3,2,partially factual,3,3,60,neutral,4,negative,4,low

In particular, the paper focuses on the limitations of semantic censorship, or filtering of strings based on their meaning. First, the paper shows that determining whether a “program” output by an LLM is permissible is an undecidable problem. Then, the paper discusses the impossibility of semantic censorship by showing that strings can undergo transformations which preserve their semantic meaning but are otherwise unintelligible except to a user who knows how to invert the transformation. Finally, the paper introduces Mosaic Prompts, a way of breaking up an impermissible prompt into permissible pieces. This paper’s primary strength is that it identifies an important issue to focus on that has been unexplored in the literature - what are the theoretical limits on the ability to filter LLM inputs or outputs based on their semantic meaning? The paper is a good exposition of this problem and the theoretical settings it considers highlight some important limitations for the task. The figures and tables also do a good job of clarifying some of the concepts in the text. Overall, the authors’ assertion that syntactic censorship is likely to be more successful than semantic censorship is well-taken from this work. This paper’s primary weakness is the number of assumptions and limitations that come into the different theoretical treatments that the paper covers. First, the paper itself admits that the treatment of Rice’s theorem for programs on Turing Machines is not generally applicable to the bounded inputs and outputs case of LLMs. Second, in the section 2.2 on the invertible transform, I believe there may be a flaw in the reasoning of the proof. Under assumption 1, the authors assume that the model is capable of following instructions such that it can produce the transformation $g$. This assumption is explicitly stated. It seems that the proof also requires that the LLM (or corresponding companion LLM that is doing censorship) is unable to compute the inverse transformation $g^{-1}$. If it were, then it could check the semantics of the un-transformed string for permissibility. This assumption weakens the power of the impossibility result in my opinion. Finally, while I think that the Mosaic Prompt approach is interesting, I do think the paper underestimates the LLM’s ability to attend to previous prompts. While in the mosaic approach the model is likely to answer early prompts, it is conceivable that once enough of the pieces of the impermissible prompt are present, one would be able to detect the impermissibility of the conversation overall. Does the impossibility result in Section 2.2 require an assumption that $g^-1$ is not computable by the permissibility model?

Is the problem space simplified at all by considering the compositionality of strings? For example, if there is an impermissible substring within a larger string, does that make the larger string automatically impermissible as well?

Does something like “fuzzy” permissibility fit into this framework at all? For example, many prompts and outputs would be considered “borderline” or have some level of “toxicity” if sent to a human rater, rather than a bright-line permissible vs. not rule. Does that make the problem any easier or harder?",537,0,0,0.7747,0.1567073171,0.8508368134000001,47,36.7413,0.0657,iclr,0.01,2,5,4,3,factual,4,4,80,polite,4,neutral,4,none,3,5,4,5,5,5,5,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,factual,4.0,4.0,80.0,polite,5.0,neutral,3.0,none,3,4,4,3,factual,4,4,80,polite,5,positive,5,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low

Their data shows a huge advantage of using this hand-held sequence technology over the standard PCR methods. The authors propose implementing a MinION quality-control step on the plants before they are distributed, so that CMD-infected plants can be removed from the supply chain before they reach local farmers. This report is short, but its impact appears to be far-reaching. Most of my comments are minor editorial suggestions, but overall the writing and readability is excellent.  Minor revisions: Public availability of the DNA sequence data. While the authors technically made the sequence files public by posting to FigShare, the standard repository for DNA sequence data is the INSDC (NCBI/EBI/DDBJ).  I highly urge the authors to create a BioProject at NCBI or EBI that houses the raw and assembled sequences (fasta files) for this effort so that other researchers in this area can easily build off this important work.  Editorial comments: Results and Discussion “We utilized the MinION to test infected material and farmers were informed within 48 hours of the specific strain of the virus that was infecting their cassava, and a resistant cassava variety was deployed.” Consider converting to two sentences. One about using the MinION and the second to cover the response.  Were resistant cassava plants really deployed within 48 hrs?  wow.  “MinION sequencing is superior to traditional methods of PCR identification, given its generation of whole genome sequences which enable the identification of the plant virus strain even if it becomes mutated or divergent, as it is not biased using primers that rely on known virus sequences.” Consider a minor re-write: “In general MinION sequencing is superior to traditional PCR methods of identification because the virus can be detected even when the PCR primers don’t work, and 2) entire viral genome sequence is generated enabling the identification of the specific viral strain, along with other molecular information, which allows for a much higher resolution of surveillance.  “In addition, we could detect virus in a plant before it showed symptoms (Table 1).”  Change to present tense to match the rest of the paragraph?  “Utilizing traditional PCR methods, three samples collected from farmer 1’s field in Tanzania tested positive for EACMVs and none were positive for ACMV.” Define EACMV and ACMV before abbreviation.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  Summary of the article Boykin et al present a pilot study aiming the application of real-time DNA sequencing for the detection of ACMV and EACMV in cassava plants in multiple crops of African East countries. This study represents the successful approaching of the most valuable feature of the MinION nanopore sequencing platform, its portability. At the same time, the authors made the maximum use of the singularities of the system by the translational application of their results, thus preventing the spread of plant viruses and to improve the crop efficiency by timely advising of farmers. This last exercise really highlights the value of such technology, particularly in the epidemiological surveillance and control of pathogens. Notwithstanding, I have some minor concerns that if addressed they would constitute an added value to the approach described. 1) I strongly recommend that authors store and make publicly available the genetic information retrieved from different sequencing runs to a specialized repository such as ENA or GenBank. 2) It would be very informative for future studies in this field that Table 1 contains additional information the average or median values of the sequence identity derived from the comparison between nanopore reads and reference sequences. In a similar way, they should declare the level of relationship between ACMV and EACMV, in terms of genome-wide nucleotide identity, in order to disclose any potential misidentification given the high error rate of nanopore-derived DNA reads. 3) The authors must be aware that there is a strong effect derived from sequencing kits used, different from Uganda/Tanzania and Kenya. They should make some correlations between the CMD severity scoring and DNA reads retrieved independently accordingly to the kits used. 4) In the same line of thoughts than above, it would be very elegant that authors will estimate the maximum time for expecting a viral DNA read just for setting a threshold and optimize the sequencing time. I have noticed that for CMD severity = 1, it took maximum 4h to retrieve viral DNA reads, using the sequencing kit SQK-RBK001. Another different history was the utilization of SQK-RBK004 in Kenya, where apparently there is not a correlation between CMD severity and viral DNA reads retrieved. In the last cases, the apparently not symptomatic plants were detected as positive in less than one hour. The setting of a time threshold for a proper detection (getting enough number of reads to estimate reliable identification) would be useful to speed up the farmers' advising and consequently the reduction of risks for the spread.",486,0,0,0.8153,0.1035542929,0.8796175122000001,37,23.8,0.103,f1000,0.0104166666666666,4,4,4,3,partially factual,3,3,68,neutral,4,positive,3,low,5,5,4,5,factual,5,5,95,polite,5,positive,5,none,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,factual,4.0,5.0,80.0,polite,4.0,positive,3.0,none,5,4,4,5,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,positive,5,low,5,4,4,5,factual,4,4,92,polite,5,positive,5,low
132,Maxime-Lefrançois,Ontologies for Observations and Actuations in Buildings: A Survey,"Spaces and elements in the buildings' environment have emerged as platforms where materializations of observations and actuations promise to be very profitable. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) paves the way to address this challenge but the heterogeneity of the represented knowledge about these artifact systems poses a real problem. Ontologies can be considered as part of the solution to overcome the IoT's inherent hurdles. A wise option promoted by recent approaches is to design networks of complementary ontologies. However, different points of view are possible and such diversity could lead to interoperability problems. This article advocates for a networked ontology infrastructure conceived on principled basis guided by documented judicious conceptualizations. In this regard, this survey points towards ontologies involved in conceptualizations of observations and actuations, where the utility of that conceptualization arises when some features of interest need to be observed or acted upon. For each of the reviewed ontologies, their fundamentals are described, their potential advantages and shortcomings are highlighted, and the use cases where these ontologies have been used are indicated. Additionally, use case examples are annotated with different ontologies in order to illustrate their capabilities and showcase the differences between reviewed ontologies. Finally, this article tries to answer two research questions: Is there a firm basis, broadly admitted by the community, for the development of such a networked ontology infrastructure for the observations and actuations in buildings? What ontologies may be considered helpful towards that goal?","In its current form, the article is a comprehensive comparative review of important ontologies that may be used to model observations and actuations in buildings.

It would have been beneficial to include experiments on a diverse set of network architectures to demonstrate the approach's effectiveness across different model types and complexities. 
2. Lack of detailed explanation for temperature, α, and β: One weakness of the paper is the limited explanation provided for the temperature parameter (T), α, and β, which are crucial components of the proposed approach. These parameters play a significant role in controlling the diversity of network parameter distributions and feature distributions, but their specific effects and optimal values are not thoroughly discussed.
3. Weakness in the conclusion: The current conclusion merely restates the experimental results and does not highlight the broader implications of the proposed approach or its potential impact on the field. The author should supplement more experiments to prove its effectiveness.

116,Reviewer-tB5V,Model and Feature Diversity for Bayesian Neural Networks in Mutual Learning,"Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) offer probability distributions for model parameters, enabling uncertainty quantification in predictions. However, they often underperform compared to deterministic neural networks. Utilizing mutual learning can effectively enhance the performance of peer BNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve BNNs performance through deep mutual learning. The proposed approaches aim to increase diversity in both network parameter distributions and feature distributions, promoting peer networks to acquire distinct features that capture different characteristics of the input, which enhances the effectiveness of mutual learning. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the classification accuracy, negative log-likelihood, and expected calibration error when compared to traditional mutual learning for BNNs.","The paper focuses on improving the accuracy of BNNs by promoting diversity in both parameter space and feature space while training two peer BNNs with mutual learning between them. More specifically, they train two variational BNNs with a mean-field Gaussian variational loss for each along with a KL divergence term between the (temperature-scaled) predictive distributions of the two models, a Wasserstein distance term between the corresponding approximate posterior distributions across the two models (added as a softplus(-distance) term), and a KL divergence term between corresponding feature distributions. On the latter term, instead of directly maximizing the distance between corresponding feature distributions, they instead do so on ""fused feature distributions"". To do so, they use learned cross-attention to fuse the features from multiple feature levels in a model (two at a time). Then, they use the KL divergence between the distributions of the fused feature distributions of the two peer networks. To derive the distributions, they use the conditional probability density defined as $p_{i|j} = \frac{K(F'_i, F'_j)}{sum_{k=1, k \noteq i}^n K(F'_k, F'_j)}$, where $K(F'_a, F'_b)$ is a kernel function between two fused feature representations. Given those conditional probs, they compute a KL divergence term. Similar to the parameter space diversity term, they add this term to the loss as softplus(-divergence). The paper claims to be the first to propose maximizing the distance between feature distributions to promote diversity. In terms of experiments, the paper includes results for ResNet models on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, measuring accuracy, NLL, and ECE as metrics, and comparing different approaches. The paper does a great job of precisely articulating the modeling approach, and discussing the relevant background info. More specifically, the proposed approach of adding terms to promote diversity in parameter and feature space is clear and would be easy to reimplement. My main concern is with the experiment section. More specifically, a few key details are unclear in the text, and importantly a deterministic baseline is missing that I believe should be present given the framing of the paper and relevant literature. Please see the Questions below. Given updates, I believe the paper would be great and I would gladly update my rating. Main:
- In the experiments, a few details are currently unclear. The following points are on Table 1, but generalize to all three tables. Please clarify these details here and in the paper.
  - Consider the ResNet20 section of Table 1. Is my understanding correct that the ""ResNet20"" results are for a pair of BNNs trained from scratch, while the ""ResNet20*"" results are for a pair of BNNs trained with the approximate posterior means set to the values from a deterministic model?
  - Is it correct that all results (all three metrics across all three approaches) are computed after averaging the predicted probs from the pair of models?
- For the experiments, a deterministic baseline is missing. Given the intro that discusses how BNNs can lag behind deterministic models in acc (though not always), the experiments lack a comparison. It would be helpful to understand how the proposed approach compares to a deterministic baselines, specifically a single deterministic model and a size-2 deep ensemble. Could you add this as a baseline? I would consider this to be a blocker for the paper given the framing and relevant literature.

Other:
- The KL divergence term is scaled by the square of the temperature -- why?
- How did you choose the values for temp, alpha, and beta? They differ between CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet. Did you ablate values?

So the question is: if face mask impact on Rt is a function of 1) social behaviour (e.g. contact rates), 2) quality and quantity of face mask usage, and 3) intrinsic properties of the viral variant circulating (R0)1, and you’re trying to quantify the economic impact of maintaining facemask use during and after a vaccine campaign using a calibration of facemask impact on Rt from an earlier time when all 3 of those factors might be different, then couldn’t your economic impact assessment be off? Yes, it could. I’m not sure that the author’s suggestion of simply widening the uncertainty in the parameter value from 5 to 50% and doing a sensitivity analysis is going to do much good, however, because it won’t answer the policy questions people have, and will leave everyone more uncertain. I think it is possible, through modeling, to recalibrate the impact of facemasks on Rt for more recent times, when better quality masks are more widely available, but the variants are more easily transmissible as well, and society has less of a pandemic, lockdown mentality1,2.

They then attempt at relating the solutions to solutions of other optimization problems:

- They show that the minimum norm interpolator also minimizes the adversarial loss (iff the adversarial perturbation is sufficiently small)
- They show that adversarial training (under certain conditions) minimizes something closely related to the LASSO and ridge regression objective for $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ attacks respectively.
- They show that similarly to square-root LASSO, adversarial training does not need knowledge of the variance and they argue that this makes adversarial training a viable alternative.
 - It seems interesting to attempt connecting AT to sparse solutions
- The initial setup and the statements of the theorems are presented in a clean way
- Existing literature is well-covered
 - My main concern is that the theoretical claims are rather weak:
    - Concerning Thm. 1, l. 122 ""minimum-norm interpolators as the outcome of adversarial training"" seems a bit of a stretch, since it is not *consistently* the outcome of adversarial training (we might be able to find a minimizer of $R^{adv}$ that is *not* a min norm interpolator). AT would imply minimum-norm interpolator if the minimizer of $R^{adv}$ was unique, but this cannot be the case since LASSO is not unique in general.
    - Prop. 2 is concerning minimum norm interpolator (so not necessarily obtainable with AT!). What makes this statement interesting for adversarial training if we need to obtain the solution through other means?
    - Prop. 4 seems to not directly relate AT to LASSO/ridge regression. Whats is the conclusion of Prop. 4? 
    - Thm. 2 exists to show that AT can replace sqrt-root LASSO. You are comparison with Lasso though – doesn't the bound have a bias in comparison with sqrt-root LASSO (eq. 10 of \[29\]). The main feature of AT seems to be the claim that $\delta^*$ is invariant to rescaling of $\varepsilon$. Can you explicitly make $\delta^*$ in Thm. 2 independent of $\varepsilon$? (currently this is not the case in theorem statement)

Comments:

- Prop. 5 maybe pick a different variable than $p$ (already used for dimensionality)
- l. 144 should have been $\delta$ instead of $\delta_{train}$?
- Maybe write ""a solution"" in l. 144 instead of ""the"".
- l. 179: Please describe the dataset in the appendix or provide a more direct pointer to \[18\].
 - Thm. 1: $\bar \delta$ depends on the $\ell_\infty$-norm regardless of the choice of norm in the adversarial training? This seems potentially loose – could you comment on it?
- Prop. 2: Do you still rely on full row rank in Prop. 2? 
- l. 158-159: Isn't the claim in \[17\] about $\ell_2$ minimum norm while your Prop. 7 is a claim about choice of norm in the adversarial training? 
- Figure 3: Could you label the plot to explain the colors? I don't understan how to interpret the plot.

The authors compared the solution of adversarial training and other regularization frameworks (minimum-norm interpolating, ridge regression, Lasso and square-root Lasso), and established close relations between adversarial training and other methods under certain conditions depending on the disturbance radius and over/under-parameterization. The authors also consider extending the result to more general loss function for linear model. 1.	The paper provides valuable insights on the relation between adversarial training and other regularization frameworks for linear regression, which contributes to the area of robust learning. The analysis is sound.
2.	The paper provides good background knowledge and details in their work. 
3.	The paper is well-organized and easy to follow overall.
 1.	In the abstract, the authors claim that adversarial training can be equivalent to parameter shrinkage methods (like ridge regression and Lasso). However, from Proposition 4, it seems the two frameworks are not equivalent, since the regularization term in the equation of Proposition 4 equals $\delta^2\left\| \beta\right\|^2 + c\delta\left\| \beta\right\|$ for some constant $c$. I am curious about how the quadratic term can affect the solution, or how close the adversarial training solution is from the parameter shrinkage solution.

2.	In the numerical experiment, the authors have not mentioned how the adversarial training is carried out in these datasets. From the code in the supplementary materials, it seems the adversarial samples are generated by the PGD attack. Please consider including more details in the paper. Also, does PGD generate sufficiently strong attacks for linear regression?
 Here are some additional questions/comments:

1.	$\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_n$ in line 126 are undefined.

2.	The authors claim in line 151 and Remark 2 that the model becomes robust as feature dimension $p$ grows, which seems not precise to me. The authors suggest that the threshold $\bar{\delta}$ increases faster, but this only guarantees that the optimal solution of adversarial training and minimum-norm interpolator agree, which does not necessarily mean more robustness. Does the risk $\mathcal{R}^{\text{adv}}$ decrease as feature dimension $p$ grows? 

3.	The paper investigates the situation where the sample features $x_i$’s are disturbed in linear regression. In applications, it is also very common that the target $y_i$’s are disturbed.

10,Reviewer-7Q1Z,An interpretable error correction method for enhancing code-to-code translation,"Transformer-based machine translation models currently dominate the field of model-based program translation. However, these models fail to provide interpretative support for the generated program translations. Moreover, researchers frequently invest substantial time and computational resources in retraining models, yet the improvement in translation accuracy is quite limited. 
To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach, $k\text{NN-ECD}$, which combines $k$-nearest-neighbor search with a key-value error correction datastore to overwrite the wrong translations of TransCoder-ST. This provides a decision-making basis for interpreting the corrected translations. Building upon this, we further propose $k\text{NN-ECS}_{m}$, a methodology that employs a distributed structure with $m$ sub-datastores connected in series,  utilizing $m$ diverse experts for multi-round error correction. Additionally, we put forward a unified name rule, encouraging the datastore to focus more on code logic and structure rather than diverse rare identifiers. Our experimental results show that our approach improves the translation accuracy from 68.9\% to 89.9\% of TransCoder-ST (for translation from Java to Python). This error correction method augments program translation, overcoming the inherent limitations of Transformer-based code translation models, such as resource-intensive retraining requirements and uninterpretable outcomes.","This paper focuses on improving Java $\rightarrow$ Python translation using error correction, rather than retraining the underlying translation model. They devise two error correction techniques (kNN-ECD and kNN-ECS) based on kNN-MT, which entails retrieving from datastores. To build this datastore, they first collect 82,665 Java functions and generate high-quality unit tests for them using EvoSuite. Then, they use TransCoder-ST to translate the Java functions paired with the unit tests to Python. From these they extract pairs of the form (failed Python function, successful Python function), which are then used to build (a) datastore(s). The datastore is organized based on two components: (1) (key, value) pairs and (2) (key, value) $\rightarrow$ token. The query to this datastore is formed by using the last decoder hidden states corresponding to the full source input (i.e., failed Python function) and partial target (i.e., possible correction generated so far). To reduce noise caused by diverse rare identifiers during retrieval, they apply the unified name rule. In kNN-ECD, only one round of correction is performed. In kNN-ECS_{m}, they perform $m$ rounds of correction, with m smaller datasets (after segmenting the large datastore into $m$ parts). Results show that kNN-ECS outperforms kNN-ECD as well as a vanilla TransCoder-ST with no error correction. - The proposed approach successfully corrects errors to a certain extent, without retraining the model or re-sampling the model many times, which is usually done in self-repair.
- The idea of multi-round error correction and the analysis done with this, varying the number of rounds, and analyzing the performance for each of these, is quite interesting and may inspire future work. - Evaluation is based on translated unit tests generated by the same model that the authors are trying to correct translation errors for. Therefore, the unit tests that are generated could be wrong, and so the evaluation is unreliable. Evaluation should be performed based on a separate, high-quality set of unit tests. Possibly datasets like HumanEval-X would be better alternatives here.
- The experiments and results are fairly limited. First, the authors focus on only Java $\rightarrow$ Python and fail to consider other languages or even the reverse direction of Python $\rightarrow$ Java. Next, Table 1 seems to be missing many baselines and other models to which their approach should be compared. Namely, the only baseline is the pure TransCoder-ST model, which is only the starting point of their approach. The authors discuss that the main advantage of their approach is that no retraining is required, so it would be important to see how their approach performs relative to a retraining-based one. For this, they could have simply fine-tuned TransCoder-ST on the error correction pairs they collected for building their datastore. Next, latency is not measured, even though the authors discuss latency in related work. It seems that retrieving from a large datastore or retrieving multiple times from smaller datastores could take a long time, so it would be important to understand how the overall latency compares to other approaches. Finally, the authors do not report results on state-of-the-art code models, so it is difficult to assess the true value of their approach.
- The authors present the unified name rule as a novelty; however, I do not find this to be that novel, given the work the authors discussed in the ""Related Work"" section.
- There are multiple aspects of the paper that are not clear.  Please see the ""Questions"" section. 1) Based on what is written in the paper, 10 Python functions with unit test cases are generated for each Java function. So, you have $(func_1, tests_1), (func_2, tests_2), (func_3, tests_3)... (func_{10}, tests_{10})$. Success is measured by executing the tests in some Python environment, where $func_i$ is considered a success if it passes all tests in $tests_i$. By this definition, suppose $func_1$ fails $tests_1$ and $func_2$ passes $tests_2$.  The paper states ""we combined the first failed Python function with the first successful Python function to form an error correction language pair."" Based on this, it seems that $(func_1, func_2)$ would be considered an error correction pair. However, there is no guarantee that $tests_1 = tests_2$, meaning that the two functions could be executed against different test suites. Therefore, $func_2$ may not actually correspond to a correction of $func_1$. Could this please be clarified? 
2) The ""interpretable decision-making"" idea is not clear to me. It seems that you are suggesting that the reasoning for predicting a specific token at a timestep $t$ can be attributed to the source and partial target function predicted so far. This is also the case for transformer-based decoders, so it is not clear to me how your approach can be considered more interpretable than a transformer as they claim.
3) In 3.2, you state that the hidden representations from the last layer of the decoder are used to build the (key,value) and query. My understanding is that the (key ,value) and query correspond to (failed Python function, partial Python function). It is not clear to me how there would be a decoder state corresponding to the failed Python function since that is passed into the encoder (Figure 1). Or is (failed Python function, partial Python function) meant to actually only represent the representation of the partial Python function generated so far, as labeled as ""Key"" in Figure 1? 
4) You claim that the improvement of ECS over ECD is ""primarily attributed to its distributed structure, which includes diverse datastore variants."" However, you do not seem to have multi-round experiments with ECD in which you repeatedly perform retrieval/correction on the same large datastore up to $m$ times. Therefore, isn't it possible that the advantage is actually from doing iterative code correction rather than the distributed nature of it?",949,0,0,0.7745000000000001,0.0229609929,0.8705494404,60,49.7816,0.2416,iclr,0.0,2,4,4,3,partially factual,4,4,82,neutral,4,negative,4,low,4,5,4,4,factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,partially factual,4.0,3.0,60.0,polite,5.0,neutral,5.0,low,4,5,5,4,factual,5,5,90,polite,5,neutral,5,low,3,4,4,4,partially factual,4,4,85,polite,5,neutral,5,low
145,Reviewer-AWzJ,Policy Rehearsing: Training Generalizable Policies for Reinforcement Learning,"Human beings can make adaptive decisions in a preparatory manner, i.e., by making preparations in advance, which offers significant advantages in scenarios where both online and offline experiences are expensive and limited. Meanwhile, current reinforcement learning methods commonly rely on numerous environment interactions but hardly obtain generalizable policies. In this paper, we introduce the idea of \textit{rehearsal} into policy optimization, where the agent plans for all possible outcomes in mind and acts adaptively according to actual responses from the environment. To effectively rehearse, we propose ReDM, an algorithm that generates a diverse and eligible set of dynamics models and then rehearse the policy via adaptive training on the generated model set. Rehearsal enables the policy to make decision plans for various hypothetical dynamics and to naturally generalize to previously unseen environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that ReDM is capable of learning a valid policy solely through rehearsal, even with \emph{zero} interaction data. We further extend ReDM to scenarios where limited or mismatched interaction data is available, and our experimental results reveal that ReDM produces high-performing policies compared to other offline RL baselines.","This work considers training an agent without online interaction or abundant offline data but only with the reward function of the target environment. Borrowing the idea of rehearsal from the cognitive mechanism, this work proposes policy rehearsal. In detail, this work hopes to train an array of models to imitate the target model. Theoretical analyses indicate that the target environment performance gap between the policy trained in these imitated models and the optimal policy can be bounded by three terms, which are further summarized as diversity and eligibility. Based on these two criteria, this work proposes two corresponding reward functions for training imitated models and then uses these models to train the policy. Also, the proposed ReDM can easily combined with offline datasets. Extensive results show the effectiveness of ReDM. - The ideas about the setting are novel and important, minimizing interaction with the environment as much as possible is an important problem in the RL community. Also, introducing rehearsal into RL is novel and enlightening.

- The writing of Sec 3.2 is clear and solid, I have roughly read all the proofs, which are written quite clearly.

- The proposed ReDM utilizes two novel terms for learning an imitated model, which is interesting and helpful.

Currently, my evaluation of this paper is really Boardline. If authors can address my concerns in Weaknesses and Questions, or point out what I have misunderstood, I'd like to update my scores accordingly. Also, I will keep active in the following discussion stage. - The connection between diversity and controlling $\epsilon_e, \epsilon_a$ is unclear. For example, if all environments are the same, i.e., there is no diversity, it is obvious that $\epsilon_a=0$ is minimal. There also needs more explanation about why $\epsilon_e$ can be controlled via diversity.

- Based on the previous points, one of my major concerns is why the proposed methods can help optimize the gap calculated in Thm 3.3. The authors have summarized the three errors in Thm 3.3 as diversity and eligibility, which indeed provides insights for analyzing this problem. But I think a more direct connection, like whether the objective in Sec 3.3 can be proven to directly control the three errors in Thm 3.3, will make the analyses more solid.

- In experiments, providing the results directly trained in the target environments as the reference will better show the results.

- Lack of some related works, like utilizing model-based methods for improving generalization \[1-3\], and finding diverse skills for unsupervised RL \[4-6\] as this work hopes to find diverse models.

\[5\] Effective diversity in population based reinforcement learning - In my opinion, the considered setting is that the agent can only get the reward function of the target task but has no knowledge about the dynamic of the target task. Is it right? Given the offline data, it is understandable that the agent can learn the dynamic to some degree. But without an offline dataset, it seems that there is no idea for the agent to learn the dynamic of the target task. 

- Based on the previous question, I'm confused about the setting of Experiment 4.1 "" ReDM With no Interaction Data"". As there are no data about the environment and the agent can not interact with the environment, how does the agent to learn about the environment?

- As Unsupervised RL considers training an agent in the environment without reward, in my opinion, the setting in this work is like training an agent and models in the environment with reward but without dynamic. As the dynamic of the target environment will vary a lot, whether finetuning the agent (as well as the model) in the target environment with few steps will be more reasonable?

- About $r_e$ for Eligibility. The proposed method is to randomly sample N trajectories and estimate the biggest return. Is this inefficient as the state space and action space are continuous in experiments? Also, what is the choice of N in experiments?

Concretely, the proposed method, *ReDM*, takes as input a reward function and a termination function and generates a set of transition functions or models. Imaginary trajectories can thus be generated by rolling out these transition models and used to warm up the policy. As some of the models may produce data close to the target environment dynamics, the policy warmed up with these data can have a good initialization when deployed to the target environment, which is helpful for subsequent fine-tuning. Additionally, the method can be modified for offline-RL settings, allowing it to learn a robust and generalizable policy even with a small amount of offline data mismatched with target environment dynamics. 

The method is motivated theoretically and contains lots of analysis like performance bound, laying foundations for future study in this new direction. Besides, the experiments on the standard gym and D4RL environment empirically prove the effectiveness of the method for both online and offline policy learning. 1. The idea is novel unlike traditional model-based RL, this new idea suggests learning a bunch of transition models from reward function and termination functions, exempting the need for interaction data. 
2. In terms of soundness, it proves empirically and theoretically that the transition models learned in this way can help warm up the policy and improve its performance when deployed in environments with diverse transition dynamics. 1. The paper writing is not attractive. In my perspective, the main paper contains too much tedious content regarding the theoretical analysis and lacks an explanation for the rehearsal framework. My suggestion would be to move some theoretical content to the appendix and include at least one figure to explain the procedures of this new rehearsal framework and what it can achieve or why we need it. People don't care about the theoretical stuff until they are attracted by the idea and want to dive into it. Thus I suggest making some figures to explain the idea or the method.
2. No standard deviation is included for experiments in Table 1. Also, there is no error bar in Figure 7. 
3. What is the $D_{TV}$ should be explained in the main paper. It is strongly related to your main theorem but without definition.
4. What is relative performance? Is it calculated through minus the baseline performance?
5. The axis *Number of models* in Figure 3 should be \[0, 10, 20, 30, 40\], right? 1. How about replacing the random model for calculating the eligible reward with a human-crafted planner? It is supposed to be helpful for improving the performance as well. I guess this can be a good direction for exploration and to make this method more practical. A simple rule-based planner is also as easily accessible as a reward function in most practical settings like robotics. 
2. In the zero interaction data setting, the method indeed works well in three simple gym environments. I wonder if the method still works well in the more complex Mujoco environment without any pre-collected interaction data.

3. The proposed method is well motivated by comprehensive preliminary theoretical analysis.
4. The experiment analysis is in-depth and insightful, which helps the readers bettere understand the effectiveness and underlying mechanism of the propose methods. 1. The environments used in the experiments are still limited. I encourage to supplement more environments to demonstrate the applicability of your proposed method is possible. Otherwise, we may argue if the solution can only be effective on some specific kinds of tasks.
2. Considering the proposed method needs to train the new dynamics models and meta-policy simultaneously, the complexity of this method and the training stability/convegence are encouraged to be clarified and analyzed.
3. The assumed accessibility to the task reward function and initial state distribution is often unrealistic in the real applications. 1. I am curious if totally no interaction data, how can the generated dynamics model approximates the real dynamics in the target environment. It seems there lacks enough grounding points to support this potential. Does there exist the probability that the generated dynamics models are far from the dynamics in the target environment? I hope to see more analysis on this during the rebuttal.
2. The D4RL benchmark in your experiments is all Mujoco tasks with low input dimensions. Could you please consider incorporating some more high-dimensional task, in which the hypothesis space is too large to narrow down?
3. In the paper, you claim that the interaction data is only used to narrow down the hypothesis space. But could you please consider how to utilize these interaction data in a more direct way to better facilitate the policy learning as the complement to the purely dynamics model learning, like finetuning the learned meta policy? Besides, I cannot agree the statement that the biasedness in the interaction data will somehow hinder the policy optimization in traditional offline RL methods. If such pre-collected trajectories are expert ones or near-optimal ones, such *biasedness* can actually help avoid some low-value and dangerous states.
4. Considering your method encourages the diversity in the model learning part, some learned dynamics models may be unreasonable though the meta policy can still achieve high returns via planning in such models, like violating the physics laws or economics laws.

(W2) Relying on BNS also limits the versatility of ZeroP (as also indicated in the Limitation section)

(W3) If I understood correctly, the key challenge here is to search for PDs that mimic the distribution of the OD. In this case, using only BNS may not be necessary.

196,Reviewer-qH2g,ZeroP: Zero-Shot Quantization via Proxy Data,"Zero-shot quantization (ZSQ) is a promising approach for achieving low-bit constraint networks without relying on the original data (OD). However, due to the high cost and privacy concerns associated with OD, it is often scarce, leading to the unsatisfactory performance of ZSQ. Most ZSQ methods rely solely on synthetic data (SD) to mitigate this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel ZSQ framework, named ZeroP, that leverages publicly available data - proxy data (PD) - as a substitute for the OD. We first explore the impact of PD on the performance of current ZSQ methods over 16 different computer vision datasets and introduce a simple and effective PD selection method based on batch-normalization statistics(BNS) to select the optimal PD. We then apply ZeroP to three state-of-the-art pure-SD (using only SD) methods, achieving 7% to 16% improvements in accuracy for MobileNetV1 on ImageNet-1K in a 4-bit setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ZeroP on extensive models and datasets. For example, ZeroP achieves a top-1 accuracy of 72.17% for ResNet-50 on ImageNet-1K in a 4-bit setting, outperforming the SOTA pure-SD method by 3.9%. Overall, our results indicate that ZeroP offers a promising solution for achieving high-performance low-bit networks without relying on original training data and opens up new avenues for using publicly available data for data-free tasks.","A simple but intuitive method that uses proxy data for ZSQ. To find the most suitable proxy data, a BNS-based distance is used where a small BNS distance indicates a higher relation between proxy data and original data. This method is simple but effective. It does provide a SOTA performance. Comprehensive and impressive experiment results.
This paper is valuable. The novelty of this paper appears constrained, particularly when considered with an earlier work that seemingly shares a similar idea.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions  The data note under review presents a brief introduction to the characterization of digital currencies called Stablecoins. This has allowed the authors to build up a novel database on stablecoins, mainly by searching the Internet. It is therefore a brief scientific review of the current state of the art on stablecoins, proposing a database that can be used by other researchers in their studies. It is in this last point that the value of the study lies. After reviewing the data note, it can be qualified as highly original, given that there are no other cross-sectional databases available for consultation by potential cryptocurrency researchers. This means that the contribution to scholarship is also high.  Regarding the structure, the data note under evaluation is of the short-paper type, so the introduction is sufficient.  There are a few issues that should be improved by the authors: In the methodology section, the authors should refer to previous database generation studies with their limitations. In the data description section, the authors should indicate a valid reason why only 30 Stablecoins were selected. In other words, originality in the attempt to construct this database is appreciated. The methodology details the criteria for selecting the sample of 30 stablecoins based on the information that appears in CoinMarketCap, the websites of the stablecoins themselves and other websites (at this point, they could mention some, perhaps including references). I understand that of the 98 listed on CoinMarketCap as of May 2022, many were excluded (down to 30) for the reasons stated. I don't know if Terra USD is no longer classified as a stablecoin after the crash that month (it dropped 40% in value). Do you guys consider keeping it in the sample? If so, I would like you to explain. I find table 1 very interesting as it raises 14 characteristics (a sufficient number) and a description of these. It is a research note that adds value to academic research on this topic. I recommend, however, to expand the references, either in the text or in Table 1, as there are many publications on stablecoins, in order to characterize stablecoins with previous studies and authors.

87,Arutselvi-Devarajan,Globalization and life lost due to tuberculosis: evidence from a multi-country study,"Background: Tuberculosis affects around 30% of the population of the world. Tuberculosis causes an increase in early mortality and thus has the potential to increase the number of years of life lost. Globalization directly or indirectly by affecting the factors that increase the susceptibility for tuberculosis infection has the potential to increase the spread and mortality due to tuberculosis. This study assessed the causal link between globalization and the years of life lost due to tuberculosis. Methods: Data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and World Bank for 2004 and 2005 were used for a number of covariates and possible mediators. Data from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) were used for the outcome variable and important globalization indicators. The primary health outcome that was studied is tuberculosis and the measure that was used to quantify tuberculosis mortality is the years of life lost (YLL). Path analysis was used. Results: The main independent variables of economic and social integration were not statistically significant. For every unit increase in the proportion of people that were using treated drinking water, there was a -0.0002 decrease in the YLL due to tuberculosis. For every unit increase in the proportion of people with earth floor, there was a 0.0002 units increase in YLL due to tuberculosis. For every unit increase in the proportion of people living using clean fuel, there was a 0.0004 decrease in the YLL due to tuberculosis. Conclusions: Social and economic globalization have no effect on the years of life lost due to tuberculosis, highlighting that globalization actually does not contribute to tuberculosis mortality. However, improving other important determinants such as sanitation, providing safe drinking water and clean households will reduce the mortality due to tuberculosis, highlighting the need to invest in them.","Approved  info_outline Alongside their report, reviewers assign a status to the article:  Approved The paper is scientifically sound in its current form and only minor, if any, improvements are suggested  Approved with reservations A number of small changes, sometimes more significant revisions are required to address specific details and improve the papers academic merit.

In contrast to embedding techniques, path-based methods exhibit inductive capabilities but encounter challenges in terms of scalability due to the exponential growth of paths. ANet addresses this issue by incorporating a priority function, inspired by the A\* algorithm for shortest-path problems, which enables the selection of crucial nodes and edges during each iteration. This novel approach effectively reduces the time and memory requirements for both training and inference processes. S1: This paper proposes an efficient GNN called A\*Net for link prediction with good scalability.

S2: A\*Net shows impressive results on various KGs. W1: Although the method proposed in this article has better scalability, the contributions from theoretical perspectives are incremental compared to NBFNet.

W2: The introduction of the parameter sharing between the priority function and predictor is somewhat unclear, and the reason why the reasoning task can be regarded as weak supervision for the priority function is not well explained. Q1: The priority function in A\*Net is similar to the attention used in RED-GNN except that A\*Net selects the nodes and edges according to the attention score. In the case where memory allows, how does the performance of A\* Net change when Top operation is disabled in Algorithm 1 (line 5 & line 7)?

Q2: If some nodes and edges are discarded in the early phase of model training, it may introduce incorrect inductive biases and prevent the model from training effectively. How do you address this issue to avoid such problems or why is this not an issue in A\*Net?

The intriguing approach of applying the A$^*$ algorithm's principle to path reasoning in KG is proposed in this paper, along with the introduction of novel methods for crafting the priority function.

2. The paper achieves state-of-the-art results on the large-scale KG reasoning dataset, ogbl-wikikg2.

3. There's a substantial enhancement in efficiency, considering both time and memory usage, as opposed to the top-performing baseline, NBFNet. The proposed method performs slightly worse than NBFnet as shown in Table 1, and no results of NBFnet are reported on tail prediction in Table 2. 1. In the context of KG reasoning, a crucial question is, how many steps are typically required for a query? According to the vanilla path reasoning in Equation 1, the number of paths increases exponentially with respect to path length. However, if the path length is typically small, this might not pose a significant problem? Moreover, when dealing with a large-scale KG, the BF algorithm would need to visit $|\mathcal{V}|$ nodes and $|\mathcal{E}|$ edges for each step, which can be quite computationally intensive. Given these considerations, it leads to the question: If the path length is usually small, could vanilla path reasoning be a more efficient choice compared to BF?

2. Another question is, can we simply leverage the idea of beam search into vanilla path reasoning? For example, we keep top-K ranked paths for each step, which may also avoid the exponential growth of the number of paths.

A*Net is inspired by the A* algorithm for solving shortest path problems, where it learns a priority function to select important nodes and edges at each iteration. This allows for the time and memory reducing for both training and inference. From an efficiency perspective, this could be considered as a path-pruning method to progressively reduce the subgraph based on the learned priority function. The empirical results also demonstrate efficiency improvement. 1. The efficiency problem caused by the explosively increasing entities in deeper propagation layers is indeed serious in the recent GNN-based inductive methods. And the proposed method makes sense and technically sound. 

2. The experimental results are impressive. The paper demonstrates the practical applications of A*Net in various settings and datasets, with the efficiency improvement compared with several recent baselines. Furthermore, the paper sets a new state-of-the-art on the million-scale dataset ogbl-wikikg2 and converges faster than embedding methods. 

3. The paper's organization is well-executed and the content is easily comprehensible.
 1. The paper's comparison to the A* algorithm seems somewhat overstated. As a derivative work of NBFNet, this paper draws an analogy to another shortest path algorithm, A*. Contrary to the Bellman-Ford algorithm that resolves the shortest path problem from the source to all other points, the A* algorithm typically addresses the shortest path problem from the source to a specific target point. However, in the context of knowledge graph (KG) reasoning, the target point is unknown, rendering the core principle of A*, assessing the estimated remaining cost to the target point, unfeasible. In fact, the A* algorithm's priority rule, involving the distance to the target node, is not pertinent to the priority function in the proposed model. The A* algorithm appears to function primarily as a promotional point, rather than as a guiding principle.

2. Perhaps due to the overemphasis on the A* analogy, the paper's true technical contributions remain unclear. Comparing the core function of NBFNet in Eq. 3 and that of A*Net in Eq. 12, the only discernible difference lies in introducing the priority score, calculated based on the embeddings of the query and the current node. Stripping away the A* algorithm framework, it essentially seems to be a path-pruning technique reliant on an attention mechanism to select the top K nodes and top L edges in each layer for efficiency's sake.

3. The paper lacks insightful contributions regarding important paths beyond a weighted version of the NBENet method. The theoretical appendix focuses solely on integrating path selection into the NBFNet framework, premised on the assumption that a certain function can distinguish important nodes. However, how to ensure that important paths are chosen is not clear. In response to this, the authors propose weight sharing between the priority function and the predictor, asserting that the reasoning task can be seen as a weak supervision for the priority function. However, this appears counterintuitive, given that the priority score is dependent on a specific query. A high predictor score, indicating that the node x answers the query (u, r_1), should not contribute to the priority score of x for a different query (u, r_2).
 1. As addressed in Weaknesses 3, could you elaborate on how weight sharing aids in the selection of important paths?

2. I observe that two handcrafted priority functions, PPR and Degree, are employed in the ablation studies. Given that high connectivity doesn't necessarily denote the importance of paths, what about the effectiveness and efficiency of a random pruning strategy, particularly with respect to the obgl_wikikg2 dataset?

3. In the Visualization section, only the results of the proposed method are displayed without any comparison. Could you clarify what distinct paths the Neural function selects compared to the two handcrafted ones? Furthermore, does the Neural-based path selection align more closely with knowledge semantics?

8,Reviewer-aJpk,AdaPlanner: Adaptive Planning from Feedback with Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated the potential in acting as autonomous agents for sequential decision-making tasks. However, most existing methods either take actions greedily without planning or rely on static plans that are not adaptable to environmental feedback. Consequently, the sequential decision-making performance of LLM agents degenerates with problem complexity and plan horizons increase. We propose a closed-loop approach, AdaPlanner, which allows the LLM agent to refine its self-generated plan adaptively in response to environmental feedback. In AdaPlanner, the LLM agent adaptively refines its plan from feedback with both in-plan and out-of-plan refinement strategies. To mitigate hallucination, we develop a code-style LLM prompt structure that facilitates plan generation across a variety of tasks, environments, and agent capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a skill discovery mechanism that leverages successful plans as few-shot exemplars, enabling the agent to plan and refine with fewer task demonstrations. Our experiments in the ALFWorld and MiniWoB++ environments demonstrate that AdaPlanner outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 3.73% and 4.11% while utilizing 2x and 600x fewer samples, respectively. The implementation of AdaPlanner is available at https://github.com/haotiansun14/AdaPlanner.","LLMs have shown success as autonomous agents that make and execute plans in sequential decision problems. Existing methods either make open-loop plans, limiting adaptability to the environment, or closed-loop plans. Existing closed-loop methods, apart from DEPS, keep the plan static but simply modify immediate actions according to environment feedback, leading to potentially sub-optimal policies. The authors introduce AdaPlanner, a closed-loop LLM planner that additionally allows for *plan* refinement during the episode. The success of their method not only relies on this, but additionally code-style prompts and a skill-discovery mechanism for few-shot exemplars. AdaPlanner outperforms existing works while relying on far fewer demonstration examples from similar tasks.  - Empirically the authors show strong results with respect to sample efficiency and asymptotic performance.

- Many ablations make it easy to understand which components of the model lead to overall success. 

- Conceptually simple approach.
 - In the evaluation section, the baselines are glossed over. This makes it hard to comprehend the distinction between their approach and the baselines. 
   - I’d recommend adding some of the Appendix descriptions to the evaluation section, and potentially referencing Table 1 more often.

- The authors use the term ‘hallucination’ a lot but do not define it.

- The authors discuss in- and out-of- plan refiners a lot before providing intuitive examples for when either would be necessary. Could the authors provide more examples earlier on in the paper?

- DEPS appears to be a relevant baseline. Could the authors include it or at least delve deeper into its limitations and why it is not appropriate?

- It appears that the largest contributor to the success of AdaPlanner, over existing approaches, is code style prompts and skill prompts. Wouldn’t it be worthwhile to apply those modifications to existing approaches, like Reflextion (Fig 4), and contrast?

This is not the place to critique the paper; the authors should generally agree with a well-written summary.

The paper proposes AdaPlanner, an LLM-based adaptive planner for text-based sequential decision-making tasks. The planner is adaptive in the sense that it can refine the generated plan/policy based on feedback. 

The contributions made in this paper include the following
1. interacting with the environment with LLM in the loop
2. a code-style prompt is engineered for LLMs to output a policy 
3. refining the LLM policy for the current task based on feedback
4. prompt tuning for new tasks based on previous interaction (termed skill discovery)

The proposed AdaPlanner is evaluated on two text-based sequential decision-making environments ALFWorld and MiniWoB++. Their experiments indicate that with feedback, LLMs can adapt the plan.
 
* The paper is well written.
* The paper focuses on extremely relevant and signifcant problems. 
 * I find the paper lacks significant details. Please see the next section for the list of questions.
* The paper employs sloppy mathematical notations.
* The paper lacks the rigor of scientific evaluation. 
* Paper misses all references to LLM-based approaches for planning with PDDL. The one that I find most relevant for code generation is ""Generalized Planning in PDDL Domains with Pretrained Large Language Models, Tom Silver, Soham Dan, Kavitha Srinivas, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Leslie Pack Kaelbling, Michael Katz”
 
**Major**

1. How is the programmatic response from LLM converted to action responses? Did the conversion require manual intervention? For instance, Figure 2 has an indentation error which would result in a wrong plan. Were such indentation errors evaluated manually? Can authors provide a list of errors made by LLMs? 
1. In line 167, what does an alignment between ‘anticipated plan’ and environment mean? How does the AdaPlanner observe the alignment? 
1. Can authors provide details about the size of the task used in the prompt (for samples) vs the size of the task that was successfully solved by AdaPlanner? To establish the claim of sample efficiency, it is important to understand if the planner is able to efficiently plan for tasks that are significantly different from the prompts.
1. The X-axis in Figure 3 indicates `# Samples per task`. Is this the number of samples provided for each trajectory? Or sum?  
1. What was the length of plans or length of trajectories generated by AdaPlanner vs other approaches? To claim the effectiveness of the AdaPlanner, it is important to compare the length of successful trajectories.
1. For skill discovery, how is the solution converted to the skill? How are skills represented? How large is the skill memory?  Were the discovered skills included in the count of samples used for training as they are training samples for the next set of trajectories?
1. It is not clear how skills are filtered and what criteria are used for the evaluation and ranking of skills.
1. What is the connection between skill discovery and prompt tuning?
1. The success rate of ""With SD"" in Figure 4d looks significantly reduced from  Figure 4a. Were different settings used for theses experiments?
1. At various places, the paper mentions ""environment feedback"". In my opinion, this is a misnomer. The feedback is not from the environment. The environment just provides the next observation, the feedback is generated by the agent itself. And the use of observation to refine a plan or next action is quite standard practice in RL. I would highly recommend dropping the term feedback from the title. 
1. The use of term plan and policy is a little confusing. A plan is a sequence of actions. A policy is a mapping from states to actions. By this definition, the `solution()` function is as a policy. In preliminaries, the planning policy ($\rho$) is conditioned on a previous plan $P_t$. However, the appendix describes the refinement prompt using the assertion error (instead of `solution()`). Isn't the assertion error providing information about the policy (the `solution()` function)? So I am confused by the terminologies. Is the $\rho$ refined conditioned on the policy or the plan? The usage of these terms is also confusing in the Preliminary section. Request authors to precisely define the mathematical notations and highlight what they represent in the examples.

**Minor**

12. In line 387, there are extra curly braces.
12. The notation $\rho$ is used in line 73 but introduced much later.
12. As the context $c_t$ is defined as a sequence of action and observations from time step $0$ to $t$, it is not clear what $c_{>t}$ means (in line 116).  
12. Open-Loop system in Figure 1 should have an arrow going from env to planner with $o_1$.
12. Statement in Line 144 ""To generate a plan .."" looks like a repetition of Line 141 ""To generate an initial plan...""
12. In line 116, if $h_t$ is obtained from $c_t$ then would it not be captured in $c_{>t}$? An example of $h_t$ would help better understand the proposed update.
12. In line 73, as $\rho$ is defined using $\Delta(A^{T})$. But the length $T$ is not fixed. 
12. In line 73 $\rho$ is defined where a plan is conditioned only on observation and goal. However, later it is conditioned on the context, plan, and goal. 



 
* The evaluations are restricted to text-based sequential decision-making problems and task where the inadmissible actions do not cause drastic changes in the environment. On the contrary, inadmissible actions are like no-ops. Further, the paper does not present analysis of plan length. Hence, the analysis is limited to zero risk environments. 
* The claim made in the abstract about skill discovery mechanism enabling agent to plan with fewer task demonstration is not substantiated in the evaluations. Evaluation in Fig. 4d only established improvement in success rate, not sample efficiency.

 1. The kind of tasks in these domains don’t seem to have interaction resolution where there are multiple conflicting causal links from the initial to the goal state which have to be resolved (including negative interactions between subgoals).

107,Reviewer-PbML,Learning to Model the World with Language,"To interact with humans and act in the world, agents need to understand the range of language that people use and relate it to the visual world. While current agents learn to execute simple language instructions, we aim to build agents that leverage diverse language—language like “this button turns on the TV” or “I put the bowls away”—that conveys general knowledge, describes the state of the world, provides interactive feedback, and more. Our key idea is that agents should interpret such diverse language as a signal that helps them predict the future: what they will observe, how the world will behave, and which situations will bring high reward. This perspective unifies language understanding with future prediction as a powerful self-supervised learning objective. We instantiate this in Dynalang, an agent that learns a multimodal world model to predict future text and image representations, and learns to act from imagined model rollouts. Unlike current agents that use language to predict actions only, Dynalang acquires a rich language understanding by learning to predict future language, video, and rewards. In addition to learning from online interaction in an environment, we show that Dynalang can be pretrained on text-only datasets, enabling learning from more general, offline datasets. From using language hints in grid worlds to navigating photorealistic home scans, Dynalang can leverage diverse types of language, e.g. environment descriptions, game rules, and instructions.","The authors argue that an RL agent should use language to predict the next state of the world, which will empower them with the ability to understand the world and thus generate a better policy, instead of directly learn to map language into actions. They propose to build a world model that can predict future language, video and rewards, and demonstrate that training an agent with the world model achieves better performance over other baselines. 1. The motivation is interesting and convincing. The large language models learn rich knowledge about the world by only predicting the next word, so it is reasonable to hypothesize that utilizing language for future prediction is a better way to help agent understand the world.
2. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines. Although the motivation is promising, the method and experiments do not support the claim.
1. It is confusing that the authors use a multimodal model including both text and images to demonstrate the idea of using language to model the world. Images also convey general knowledge and describe the state of the world, then why can't we also model the world with images / videos? The authors should provide more evidence to demonstrate the unique importance of language to support their claim.
2. The method proposed in this paper is quite like the Dreamer V3 model \[1\] with additional text input. In Dreamer V3 paper, they have already demonstrated the effectiveness of their method, and the authors seem to simply apply it on environments that include text. Then, how to clarify that the improvements come from the the model architecture itself or the text part? There are no experiments to demonstrate this. Notice that the author even don't compare with other model-based methods that are more similar to their proposed method, although they claim they compared with them in the introduction.

The proposed method is claimed to align the visual-linguistic representations better, while encouraging the models to understand the world-dynamics in a generative modeling manner.
The method is tested on four simulated embodied environments where the agents follow certain language instructions, where performance gains are reported against two off-policy RL baselines. - The observed multimodal alignment mechanism is interesting and with experimental justification.
- The overall proposed method is neat, where the generative mechanism is a sound and interesting idea to model the visual-linguistic dynamics of the work.
- Consuming all modalities in one model as conditional generative models is neat.
- The paper is well written and easy to follow. - The title is a bit over-claimed, in the sense that the proposed model is still learning to model “one environment” at a time, particularly for the action dynamics as multimodal representation generation. At least an experiment or novel method is required to learn to model some worlds (environments) and generalize to a held-out test world – this would justify the “modeling the world” parts of the claims.
- While claimed to be flexible, in many applications, the instructions of a task will only take place at the beginning of the episode while the rest is the robots’ job to accomplish the instructed tasks, where the proposed multimodal alignment will only be performed from the beginning few frames of the episode. How does the proposed method work under such conditions? E.g., how would the method benefit from such an alignment in environments such as ALFRED \[1\] or TEACh \[2\]?
- In Section 4.4, the performance of the actual SOTA models need to be reported as well, even if the proposed method is inferior to them. There are reasons why modularization and use of certain foundation models is beneficial in these long horizon complex (at least closer to) real world tasks.
- The environments, if at all except for navigation, are all quite toy-ish, where the visual observations are of fairly low fidelity. Since the proposed method heavily relies on the future representation predictions, examining the method on more realistic embodied environments would strengthen the work more.

AFT (1) enables transfer from multiple pre-trained models, even over multiple modalities, with minimal training overhead and no inference overhead; (2) selectively transfers the information in the pre-trained features most relevant for the downstream task, through a prior that favors low mutual information between the downstream inputs and features given the pre-trained features; (3) performs feature transfer in an efficient kernel formulation that prioritizes the most relevant degrees of freedom. Empirically, AFT delivers a substantial boost in performance across diverse vision, language, and multi-modal datasets, relative to both standard transfer learning and knowledge distillation with the downstream model.","This paper proposes Adaptive Feature Transfer (AFT) to transfer from an arbitrary set of pre-trained models into a single downstream model. When fine-tuning the downstream model, AFT introduces an informative prior favoring low mutual information between the downstream inputs and features given the pre-trained features. It then efficiently optimizes it by exploiting a kernel formulation of the objective. This paper conducts experiments on multiple vision, language, and multi-modal datasets, and AFT outperforms standard transfer learning and knowledge distillation methods. 1 This paper explores an interesting problem of efficient transfer learning from arbitrary pre-trained models. 
 
2 The proposed AFT method is efficient and easy to implement. It is evaluated on multiple datasets on various tasks, including vision, language, and multi-modal, and outperforms standard fine-tuning and knowledge distillation methods.
 
3 This paper is clearly written and presented, and the proposed method is easy to follow. 1 Compared with the knowledge distillation mentioned in this paper (KD), the authors emphasize the contribution that KD transforms the downstream (student) features, while the proposed AFT transforms the pre-trained (teacher) features. However, in the general feature-based knowledge distillation framework \[1\], both teacher and student features can be transformed before minimizing their distances. This makes the proposed method a simple variant in the feature-based knowledge distillation framework and thus lack novelty.  

2 Some related works are missing in this paper, including those improving standard transfer learning and those considering transfer learning from multiple pre-trained models. For example, \[2\] also proposes to match pre-trained features and downstream features during transfer learning. \[3\] and \[4\] also consider transfer learning from multiple pre-trained models and propose to use features or knowledge distillation from pre-trained models. More related works in these two topics should be discussed in the paper. In experiments, some of these more advanced transfer learning methods should be compared, instead of only comparing AFT with standard transfer learning or knowledge distillation.

3 Some issues in the experiments. 

(1) It seems that in this paper, the pre-trained models are stronger than downstream models. Figures 2(c) and 3(c) also show that transfer learning by directly using pre-trained models leads to better results than AFT. This makes the problem setting in the experiments less convincing, especially considering that the linear probe from pre-trained models is also efficient.
 
(2) It is good to see experiments from vision, language, and multi-modal tasks, but in each task, only a few datasets are evaluated, and most of them seem to be easy.
 
(3) Transfer learning from multiple models is interesting, but currently, the number of models in the experiments is still small, and the improvements by using more pre-trained models are not clear from the results.

AFT (1) enables transfer from multiple pre-trained models, even over multiple modalities, with minimal training overhead and no inference overhead; (2) selectively transfers the information in the pre-trained features most relevant for the downstream task, through a prior that favors low mutual information between the downstream inputs and features given the pre-trained features; (3) performs feature transfer in an efficient kernel formulation that prioritizes the most relevant degrees of freedom. Empirically, AFT delivers a substantial boost in performance across diverse vision, language, and multi-modal datasets, relative to both standard transfer learning and knowledge distillation with the downstream model.","The paper proposes Adaptive Feature Transfer (AFT), a downstream adaptation technique that operates directly on features, thereby decoupling the choice of the pre-trained model architecture from the downstream one. AFT enables combining different pre-trained architectures together during adaptation while distilling only the relevant information for the downstream task to the final model. The algorithm is validated across a diverse set of vision, language and vision-language tasks and compared against knowledge distillation and transfer learning algorithms. 1. The proposed method allows to distill features learned with different architectures on possibly different modalities to any given architecture 
2. The method is validated on both vision, language and vision-language tasks 1. The proposed method promises to distill features from **any** set of models to a given model once the downstream task is know. The paper is positioned as a generic method that could be applied to any set of models (possibly containing architectures different to the downstream one). However, while the presented theory to justify the method is sound and generic, the empirical results do not seem to support the claim. For example, in Figure 1 (right) and Figure 2 (b) adding convolutional features to a ViT based downstream model seem to reduce the performance of the model. Why is it the case? To me it seems to suggest that the proposed method is not strong enough to reject some features that will lead to a worse downstream model. 
    - If this is the case the current algorithm should be coupled with model selection techniques to pick the best features that are more likely to help (see \[1\] and reference therein). Can the authors comment on this more?
2. The previous limitation gets even worse when the set of conditioning models gets larger since the signal to noise ratio drops, making extracting the relevant information for the downstream task even harder. I suggest the authors to consider comparing with explicit sparsity inducing methods as the ones proposed in \[2\] and the references therein.
3. The final algorithm is optimizing theta and rho jointly. However, one would expect \rho being optimized more often than \theta. Typically, this is done with bi-level optimization techniques or simple rewriting \rho in closed form for each given \theta. Did the authors try those more natural alternatives? If \rho is not optimized fast enough the most likely trajectory induced by SGD will be around a stationary point of \rho which leads to a maximally insensitive/uninformative \rho which will be reasonably good on average for many possible \theta, however not optimal for any in particular.

66,Reviewer-QqHJ,Efficient Transfer Learning from Arbitrary Pre-Trained Models,"Transfer learning typically involves loading pre-trained weights as an initialization, followed by fine-tuning on a downstream task. As pre-trained models become ever larger, this procedure is becoming prohibitively expensive, as we are forced to re-use the pre-trained architecture for fine-tuning. This procedure also precludes combining multiple pre-trained models that learn complementary information. Moreover, alternatives such as knowledge distillation do not reflect that we wish to transfer aspects of the pre-trained representation that are most relevant to the downstream task. To address these challenges, we introduce Adaptive Feature Transfer (AFT). Instead of transferring weights, AFT operates purely on features, thereby decoupling the choice of the pre-trained model from the possibly smaller downstream model.

The paper at the end uses a stronger regularized loss by only minimizing the feature distance in the downstream and pre-trained space to make the training more robust. The results show that AFT outperforms KD on vision and language tasks and architectures. 1. The paper observes that the stronger regularization (using kernels) on the regularization term can further improve the results. 

2. The proposed approach outperforms KD on various tasks and architectures. 1. I do not fully understand what is the main difference between AFT with $\rho$ and KD, namely, the equation (7) and (8). Is the main difference that in equation (7) you downsample the pre-trained features and in equation (8) you upsample the downstream features? If yes, is there mathematical proof (or visualization, other experiments, etc) that this difference really makes the model learn the essential information of downstream tasks and discard useless information?

2. Some parts of Section 3.2 are unclear. 

(1) There is a missing $\prime$ in the first kernel definition, the definition of applying the kernel function to vector is undefined in equation (9), $X$ and $X^{\prime}$ should be the same according to Algorithm 1 but not mentioned in the text.

(2) Why the $\rho$ in Section 3.2 does not downsample the feature to the shape of the downstream features ($d_{\phi}$)?

(3) How to optimize U to make sure it is orthogonal?

(4) In Algorithm 1, the definition of $\hat{L}(\theta)$ is missing and $\hat{Y}_{batch}$ is not used.

3. The evaluation is conducted only on small subsets of benchmarks. Using more datasets and reporting the average results would make the results more convincing (like datasets used in few-shot experiments in CLIP, GLUE, SuperGLUE, Winogrande, etc). Why choose Eq (7) as the starting point to develop AFT rather than equation (8), as in Figure 4, the results of AFT w/o kernel (optimizing Eq 7 only) are not better than STL (maybe KD either).",345,0,5,0.7134,0.107183908,0.9178090692,60,47.8521,0.069,iclr,0.0,3,4,3,3,factual,3,4,70,polite,4,negative,3,low,5,4,4,5,factual,5,5,88,polite,5,neutral,5,low,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,factual,4.0,4.0,70.0,polite,4.0,neutral,3.0,low,3,3,4,3,factual,4,4,75,neutral,5,neutral,5,low,2,4,3,4,partially factual,3,3,70,polite,4,neutral,4,low

Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, such as experience rehearsal, regularization, and parameter isolation, to address this problem. Although almost zero forgetting can be achieved in task-incremental learning, class-incremental learning remains highly challenging due to the problem of inter-task class separation. Limited access to previous task data makes it difficult to discriminate between classes of current and previous tasks. To address this issue, we propose `Attention-Guided Incremental Learning' (AGILE), a novel rehearsal-based CL approach that incorporates compact task-attention to effectively reduce interference between tasks.

Through extensive empirical evaluation we show that AGILE significantly improves generalization performance by mitigating task interference and outperforms rehearsal-based approaches in several CL scenarios. Furthermore AGILE can scale well to a large number of tasks with minimal overhead while remaining well-calibrated with reduced task-recency bias.","Inspired by the notion that most methods that work in a task-incremental scenario can achieve almost zero forgetting, the authors introduce AGILE (Attention-Guided Incremental Learning). The main idea is to break down a class incremental problem into two sub-problems: Task-ID prediction (TP) and within-task prediction (WP). Once the first one is solved, the problem can be treated as a Task-Incremental, as the predicted task-id is already available. The authors suggest using task-specific projections to condition the feature vector. This conditioned vector passes through a task-specific module: task prediction and feature importance. During inference, the output of each module is concatenated to obtain the prediction. The authors demonstrate good performance in both task and class incremental scenarios. - The authors work under the assumption that the incremental Class problem can be transformed into a task-incremental problem.
    - However, I can't entirely agree that this is a ""necessary and sufficient"" solution. In fact, there is a probability that working the problem in this way helps the model lose generalization in the representations it generates, and the only reason why this does not happen in the proposed solution is that they use a buffer to store previous tasks.
    - Even so it is a problem that is not widely attacked, but that can be a good option in many cases, especially if it's motivated by the idea of GWT.
- The approach comprises many different components that have a good synergy between them. It is beneficial that the authors add Table 2 to show the importance of each loss. - Using EMA is a critical point in the proposal, and the authors do not mention it too much. EMA can also be used to reduce weight modification, meaning that it can mitigate forgetting with a favorable beta. The authors present it to increase generalization.
    - Experiments showing evidence that it increases generalization could help mitigate the doubts.
    - Did you have an analysis of the beta value? 
- It is challenging to understand where there are linear layers and where there is soft attention in the proposed methods. The image does not help.
    - It could be helpful to decrease the amount of terms, names or losses used in the explanation.
    - For example, from the Figure, one can assume that there is one Task-Attention Module for each task. However, the Task-Attention Module is shared, no?

Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. - The paper reads well and is easy to follow.
- Class-incremental learning is indeed a more challenging setting than task-incremental learning. - The idea of using task-attention or task embedding vector is not quite novel. For example, DyTox \[1\] also has a task attention module, L2P \[2\] leverages task-specific prompts. 
- Following the first one, I think the paper misses several recent competitive methods to compare against. For example, I understand both DyTox and L2P are based on transformers.

More specifically, they suggest analyzing cross entropy through the Fourier transform. 1. This paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The experimental section of this paper is fairly comprehensive.  The authors' experimental objects have broadly encompassed the latest open-source large models. Although it lacks large language models like GPT-3.5 (the cross entropy can still be obtained through APIs).

 1. Motivation. The motivation of the paper is not clear, as the authors do not clearly explain why the CE of human language would exhibit periodicity. In the related work section, they briefly mention previous works, but in my view, dialogue tasks are just a specific case of text generation. Overall, skipping the motivation part significantly reduces the soundness of this paper.

2. Method. The authors' method simply involves applying a FFT to the CE sequences, which I believe lacks substantial novelty. Why haven't the authors considered using the information in the frequency domain as input to a deep neural network to incorporate a powerful NN? Why only analyze information in the frequency domain using spectral similarity metrics? Additionally, most of these metrics have already been presented in \[1\]. Which method would better utilize this information for discrimination? In conclusion, the proposed method by the authors lacks both sufficient contribution and profound insight.

3. Experiments.  In the experimental section, the authors did not compare against sufficient baselines. For instance, could we achieve good results by only training a contrastive model using human-generated text and LLM-generated text? How helpful is the frequency domain information in discriminating texts?

Fourier Analysis of the Cross-Entropy of language (FACE) is inspired by NLP and psycholinguistic studies suggesting that surprisal is not uniformly distributed in natural text (e.g., content words tend to be more surprising than function words), occurring periodically. For a given generated text, FACE computes a discrete Fourier transform of the token-level cross-entropy sequence (under a separate FACE evaluation LM). Similarity between the vector of frequency magnitudes and that from a randomly selected, natural text corpus are then computed. The paper considers several definitions of FACE metrics, including spectral overlap, cosine similarity, and Pearson/Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients.

LMs from 125 million to over 7 billion parameters are evaluated on NLG of Wikipedia articles, news articles, and stories (with a short prompt of 35 subword tokens provided). Ultimately, FACE is found to be correlated with human judgments of how “human-like”, “sensible”, and “interesting” the generations are. The relationship is not as strong as an existing intrinsic measure, MAUVE. The relative ranking of decoding methods according to FACE agrees with prior works (e.g., greedy decoding < nucleus), as do model size (smaller models produce lower quality generations than larger models). The metric is well-motivated, evaluating whether generated text matches the surprisal statistics of natural text. The algorithm is simple and described sufficiently clearly. FACE is an automatic measure of NLG quality that is, on the face of it, complementary to existing measures. This paper would be of interest to many who work on (large) language models. While FACE is motivated by the desire to match surprisal statistics of natural text, it was not clear how different FACE is from existing metrics. Computing correlation between FACE and existing metrics would help alleviate this, as would providing anecdotes of cases with high/low FACE score vs. high/low MAUVE score, for instance.

The main idea is to compute the similarity between the spectra of cross-entropy in model-generated texts and human-written texts. Experimental results show that FACE as a computationally efficient metric can scale with model size and reflect the outcomes of different sampling methods for decoding. 1. The idea to introduce the spectra of cross-entropy into the evaluation task of open-ended text generation is interesting since it may include some patterns (e.g. periodical patterns) to identify the difference between model-generated texts and human-written texts.

2. This paper is overall well-written and easy to follow. 1. The proposed method lacks deeper analysis on the spectrum of cross entropy in the evaluation task. The authors only use the spectrum of cross entropy as a feature vector of texts to compute similarities without clearly describing the characteristics of texts it can reflect. This seems like an empirical try without definite intuitions or theoretical supports. In comparison, the features which are commonly used in the existing metrics such as n-gram statistics (in BLEU) and contextual hidden vectors (in BERTScore) intuitively indicate the surface-level and semantic-level representation of texts, respectively.

2. From Table 5, the performance of SO is still worse than that of MAUVE proposed in 2021. I understand that pursuing SOTA is not necessary for each paper. But the authors should provide more insights into the advantages of SO over MAUVE in other aspects.

3. In Section 4.4, the authors mention that they use GPT-2 of different scales to compute the spectra of GPT-2 output data. I wonder whether this setting can introduce potential bias because the cross entropy may be exceptionally low when using GPT-2 to evaluate its own output data from my experience.

I personally really like the authors' attempt to interpret the metric. Understanding the why is sometimes much more important than understanding the how. 1.
